\subsection{Graphical investigation of Modified Surface Waves (MSW), Modified Acoustic Modes (MAM) and Modified Internal Modes (MIM)}
\label{SubSectionPotBranches}

The compressible and stratified ocean is now assumed to be bounded. Wave solutions must thus satisfy both the inner \ref{EqFullDispera} and boundary \ref{EqFullDisperb} dispersion relations. In phase space, they must lie at the intersections of the inner and boundary dispersion surfaces, which are plotted simultaneously on Figure \oldref{FigDispSolutions}.

%For pure-imaginary vertical wave numbers, the inner dispersion surface is folded both for large and small pulsations. For real vertical wave-numbers branches are present in the upper and lower regions as could be expected by adding the transformations already observed in figure \ref{FigFullHomogeneous} when $\epsilon_i$ and $\epsilon_a$ were separately non zero. In the large-pulsation region, the upper branch of the inner dispersion surface is similar to figure (\oldref{FigFullHomogeneous}.c) and, once again, could not be distinguished from the $\omega^2=\omega_a^2$ surface. The same is true in the small-pulsation region where the lower branch of the inner dispersion surface could this time not be distinguished from the $\omega^2=\omega_i^2$ surface. This is a consequence of the separation of the roots of the inner dispersion relation \ref{solseq} or equivalently of the separation of the upper, acoustic and lower, acoustic branches already observed in figure \ref{FigFullHomogeneous}: when $\epsilon_i$ and $\epsilon_a$ are simultaneously non zero, MAW and MIW can simultaneously propagate. Nevertheless, relations \ref{DispAcousDT} and \ref{DispRaysDT} show that at higher order in this small parameters, their dispersion relations are modified by the stratification and/or the compressibility of the ocean. Figure \oldref{FigDispSolutions}.d additionally provides all dispersion surface branches on the same plot. It confirms inequality \ref{RelInequal}. The inner-dispersion surface for pure-imaginary wave-numbers is bounded by the same surfaces for real wave-numbers.\\
For real vertical wavenumbers ($k_z\in\mathbb{R}$, Figure \oldref{FigDispSolutions}a), the boundary dispersion surface is a piecewise surface. It includes several branches that are vertical in $(\delta_x, \delta_z, \log_{10}(\omega)$) space at $\delta_z \approx n\pi$ (small $\omega$) and at $\delta_z \approx \pi/2+m\pi$ (large $\omega$) with $n\in\mathbb{N}^\ast$ and $m\in\mathbb{N}$. The intersection of these branches with inner dispersion relation surfaces result in a number of constrained vertical wavenumbers (according to $n$ and $m$), the resulting wave solutions will thus be called {\it modes}. The two intersections correspond to {\it Modified Internal Modes (MIM),  $n\in\mathbb{N}^\ast$} and to {\it Modified Acoustic Modes (MAM), $m\in\mathbb{N}$}.\\
For purely imaginary wavenumbers (Eq. \ref{EqFullDisperbi}), the boundary surface (Figure \oldref{FigDispSolutions}b) looks like an horizontal hyperbolic surface which intersects the surface-wave surface. Far from the origin $(\delta_x,\delta_z)=(0,0)$, at the intersection points, $|\delta_z|$ is close to $\delta_x$.
%\textit{Numerical approximations of wave solutions in a bounded ocean:}\\
%Figure \ref{FigDispSolutions} confirms for this model of compressible, stratified, free-surface ocean, the existing of three types of intersections between the inner and boundary dispersion surfaces and, as a consequence, three regions of phase-space where waves can propagate in a bounded ocean. These intersections are shown by three lines of color points. The black-point intersection corresponds to wave-solutions propagating with a pure imaginary vertical wave-number in the middle-range pulsation region (figures \oldref{FigDispSolutions}.b, c and d). These are surface (edge) vertically-vanishing waves propagating in a compressible, stratified ocean, hereafter named Modified Surface Waves (MSW). Figure \oldref{FigDispSolutions}.d shows that they occupy a region of phase-space where the inner dispersion surface is approximately vertical and tangent to the $\delta_x\approx\delta_{z,i}$ plane meaning that the influence of compressibility and stratification (gravity) are both small. 
%
%The red and blue lines of points indicate that two remaining wave-solutions are possible, this time with real vertical wave-numbers. One (blue points) is an intersection of the boundary dispersion surface with the upper acoustic branch of the inner dispersion surface (figures \oldref{FigDispSolutions}.a, c and d), the other (red points) is an intersection of the same boundary dispersion surface with the lower stratification branch of the inner dispersion surface (figures \oldref{FigDispSolutions}.a and d). Since in both cases, vertical wave-numbers are quantified ($\delta_z = \pi/2+m\pi$ and $\delta_z \approx n\pi$), the resulting wave solutions can be associated to respectively Modified Acoustic Modes (MAM) and Modified Internal Modes (MIM), these modes being modified by both compressibility and stratification (gravity).\\
\paragraph{Long-wave solutions}
For long waves ($|\delta_z| \ll 1$), the boundary dispersion surfaces for real and purely imaginary $\delta_z$ coincide. Indeed, the development of the boundary relation is well approximated by $\omega^2\approx \delta_x^2$ in both cases (a better approximation is given in Eq. \ref{eqomegalongwavereal}).
Figure \oldref{FigDisLongpSolutions} shows the different branches close to the origin $(\delta_x, \delta_z)=(0,0)$. The acoustic-wave surface is not shown since it does not intersect the boundary dispersion surface near the origin (as proven in \S\oldref{SubSectionLongWavesrealdz}).

\end{figure}
While for very small $\delta_x$, the boundary dispersion surface intersects the internal-wave branch (with $\delta_z$ real), for larger values, it intersects the surface-wave branch (with $\delta_z$ pure imaginary). As will be shown in section \oldref{SubSectionLongWavesrealdz}, the switch between the two intersections is at $\delta_x=\delta_{x,0}\approx \epsilon_i$ (and for a vanishing vertical wavenumber $\delta_z=0$). At these wavenumbers, we also have $\omega \approx \epsilon_i$ and thus,as mentioned in \cite{dukowicz_2013}, the barotropic mode frequency saturates at the buoyancy frequency. However for larger horizontal wavenumbers ($\delta_x \ge \epsilon_i$), a vertically evanescent surface wave is found.
\paragraph{Summary}
In the context of a bounded ocean, three types of wave solutions are graphically identified, spreading on the three branches of inner dispersion surface, while satisfying the boundary dispersion relation: internal gravity (in a stratified ocean), acoustic (in a compressible ocean) and surface waves (in a free-surface ocean). They are investigated in following using Taylor expansions of the general roots $\omega_{\pm}$, with respect to small parameters $(\epsilon_i,\ \epsilon_a)$, leading to simple approximations of wave dispersion relations. When needed, asymptotic relations are derived with respect to $\delta_x$, $\delta_z$ or $\omega$. Taylor expansions will give indications of how usual wave solutions can be modified by gravity and stratification $(\epsilon_i)$, and/or by compressibility $(\epsilon_a)$.

\subsection{Real $\delta_z$: modified internal and acoustic waves}
As shown in \S\oldref{realwavenumber}, as long as $\delta_z$ is not close to zero, upper (acoustic) and lower (gravity) branches of the inner dispersion surface for real $\delta_z$ are well-separated and MAM and MIM solutions can thus be studied independently. The case of long waves with $\delta_z \approx 0$ is discussed in subsection \oldref{SubSectionLongWavesrealdz}.
%
\subsubsection{Development of internal-gravity modes modified by compressibility (MIM)}
\label{SubSectionGraphicMIW}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%The mode-0 (barotropic) MIM solution will be investigated in section \ref{SubSectionGraphicMSW} and, as a consequence, only solutions for not small vertical wave-numbers needs to be explored here.
Waves can propagate horizontally between the bottom and surface of the ocean as in a wave guide. Internal gravity modes are  well-known such examples \citep{gill_1982}. In the previous section, graphical inspections of wave solutions confirmed that gravity waves with constrained vertical wavenumbers could be found at the intersection of inner and boundary dispersion surfaces.
We have also shown in \S\oldref{realwavenumber} that the root of the inner dispersion relation corresponding to internal gravity waves is well-approximated by $\omega_i^2$. Making $\omega^2(\delta_x) \approx\omega_i^2$ in the boundary dispersion relation \ref{EqFullDisperb} leads to 
%\[
%	   \label{DispSysIntModesab}
%	\omega^2(\delta_x) \approx\omega_i^2\implies	\frac{\delta_x^2}
	%	{\delta_z/\tan(\delta_z)+\frac{\epsilon_i^2+\epsilon_a^2}{2}}	\approx
	%	\frac{\epsilon_i^2 \delta_x^2}{\delta_x^2
	%	+\delta_z^2+\frac{1}{4}\left(
	%	\epsilon_i^2+\epsilon_a^2\right)^2}
%\]
%
\begin{equation}
		\frac{1}
{\delta_z/\tan(\delta_z)+\frac{\epsilon_i^2+\epsilon_a^2}{2}}
\approx
\frac{\epsilon_i^2}{\delta_x^2
	+\delta_z^2+\frac{1}{4}\left(
	\epsilon_i^2+\epsilon_a^2\right)^2}
\label{equimim}
\end{equation}
Since we assume here that $\delta_z$ is not close to 0, the right-hand side of \ref{equimim} is always small and thus $\delta_z/\tan(\delta_z)$ has to be large, i.e., the vertical wavenumber $\delta_z$ is close to $n\pi$ with $n$ a non-zero integer. This agrees with the internal gravity wave solution found graphically in subsection \oldref{SubSectionPotBranches}.

In order to refine the approximation, we equate the squared frequency given by the surface dispersion relation \ref{EqFullDisperb} to $\omega_-^2$, given by the inner dispersion relation \ref{solseq}. This forms a non-linear equation for $\delta_z$ whose solution can be approximated using two passes of a Newton algorithm starting from $\delta_z=\delta_{z,n}$. Finally a Taylor development in $\epsilon_i, \epsilon_a$ leads to:
\begin{equation}
\delta_{z}(\delta_x)=\delta_{z,mim}(\delta_x)=
	\delta_{z,n}
	\left(
	1+\frac{\epsilon_i^2}{\delta_x^2+\delta_{z,n}^2}
	+\frac{(\delta_x^2-\delta_{z,n}^2)}{(\delta_x^2+\delta_{z,n}^2)^3}\epsilon_i^4
	\right)
	+\mathrm{O}	((\epsilon_i^2+\epsilon_a^2)^3)
	\label{ParamallMIM1}
\end{equation}
%\nhi{idem 'ordre 2 inclus}
%\hi{
%\begin{equation}
%\delta_{z}(\delta_x)=\delta_{z,mim}(\delta_x)=
%\delta_{z,n}
%\left(
%1+\frac{\epsilon_i^2}{\delta_{z,n}^2}
%-\frac{1}{(\delta_{z,n}^4)}\epsilon_i^4
%\right)
%+\mathrm{O}	(\epsilon_i^6)
%\end{equation}
%}
A development for the frequency $\omega^2$ can be obtained by injecting expression \ref{ParamallMIM1} of $\delta_z$ in the general expression \ref{DispRaysDT} in the unbounded domain case. The usual dispersion relation given in Table \oldref{TableWave solutions}  writes in dimensional form:
\[
\omega^2=\left.\omega_{iwr}^2\right|_{\delta_z=\delta_{z,n}}=\epsilon_i^2\frac{\delta_x^2}{\delta_x^2+\delta_{z,n}^2}
\]
Considering only the first order correction to this relation, we can omit all terms of order 3 in $(\epsilon_i^2+\epsilon_a^2)$ in \ref{DispRaysDT} to get:
 \begin{equation}
\omega^2(\delta_x)=\omega_{mim}^2(\delta_x)=
\epsilon_i^2\frac{\delta_x^2}{\delta_x^2+\delta_{z,n}^2}
\left(1-\frac{2\epsilon_i^2\delta_{z,n}^2}{(\delta_x^2+\delta_{z,n}^2)^2}\right) +\mathrm{O}	((\epsilon_i^2+\epsilon_a^2)^3)
\label{ParamallMIM2}
\end{equation}
%\nhi{idem 'ordre 2 inclus}
%\hi{
%	\begin{equation}
%\omega^2(\delta_x)=\omega_{mim}^2(\delta_x)=
%\epsilon_i^2\frac{\delta_x^2}{\delta_{z,n}^2}
%\left(1-\frac{2\epsilon_i^2}{\delta_{z,n}^2}\right) +\mathrm{O}	(\epsilon_i^6)
%	\end{equation}
%}
Therefore, the main correction to the usual dispersion relation comes from the fact that $\delta_z$ is not exactly equal to $\delta_{z,n}=n\pi$.
%This shows that the internal gravity modes are robust to compressibility since there is no dependency to $\epsilon_a$ at orders lower than 4. This agrees with the separation of the roots $\omega_\pm$ of the inner dispersion relation for real vertical wave-numbers.
%\\
%A simpler parametric relation can further be found in the vicinity of $\delta_{z,n}^0$ in the long-wave limit using a Taylor development for vanishing $\delta_x$, $\epsilon_i$ and $\epsilon_a$:
%\begin{subequations}
%	   \label{EqParamInt}
%	\begin{alignat}{2}	
%	   \label{ParamMIM1}
%	   %
%		& \delta_z(\delta_x)=\delta_{z,lmim\pi}(\delta_x) &&= 
%		\delta_{z,n}^0+\frac{\epsilon_i^2}{\delta_{z,n}^0} \left(
%		1-\frac{\delta_x^2}{(\delta_{z,n}^0)^2} \right)
%		+\mathrm{O}	(\delta_x^4,\epsilon_i^4,\epsilon_a^4)\\[3mm]
%		%
%	   \label{ParamMIM2}
%		& \omega(\delta_x)=\omega_{lmim\pi}(\delta_x) &&=\epsilon_i\frac{\delta_x}{\delta_{z,n}^0} 
%		\left( 1
%		-\frac{\delta_x^2}{2(\delta_{z,n}^0)^2} \right)
%		+\mathrm{O}	(\delta_x^5,\epsilon_i^3,\epsilon_a^3)
%	\end{alignat}
%\end{subequations}
%For a vanishing horizontal wave-number, these parametric relations show that the pulsation vanishes too but the vertical wave-number is not exactly equal to $\delta_{z,n}^0$ and $\delta_z$ varies with the square of the stratification parameter $(\epsilon_i)$.\\
%This approximate solution is plotted in figure (\oldref{Fig_Approx}.b) (red dash-dotted line) together with the MIM approximation $(\ \delta_{z,mim}(\delta_x),\ \omega_{mim}(\delta_x)\ )$ (red dashed line). The latter MIM approximation cannot be distinguished from the numerical solution.

\subsubsection{Development of acoustic modes modified by gravity (MAM)}
\label{SubSectionGraphicMAW}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%\subsection{Compressible zero-gravity ocean}
%In the particular case of zero-gravity ocean ($\epsilon_i = 0$), the dispersion relations %(\ref{EqFullDisper}) simplify to:

%\begin{subequations}
%	\begin{alignat}{2}	
 %		& \delta_x^2+\delta_z^2 &&=\epsilon_a^2 (\omega^2-\frac{1}{4})\\
%		& \omega^2 &&=\frac{\delta_x^2\ tan(\delta_z)}
%		{\delta_z+\frac{\epsilon_a^2}			{2}tan(\delta_z)}
%		=\frac{\delta_x^2}{\frac{\epsilon_a^2}{2}+\delta_z cotan(\delta_z)}
%	\end{alignat}
%\end{subequations}
Here, we use the fact that the root of the inner dispersion relation corresponding to internal gravity waves is well-approximated by $\omega_a^2$. Making $\omega^2(\delta_x) \approx\omega_a^2$ in the boundary dispersion relation \ref{EqFullDisperb} leads to:
%\[
%1/\omega^2(\delta_x) \approx 1/\omega_a^2\implies
%\frac{\delta_z/\tan(\delta_z)+\frac{\epsilon_i^2+\epsilon_a^2}{2}}
%{\delta_x^2}
%\approx
%\frac{\epsilon_a^2}{\delta_x^2
%	+\delta_z^2+\frac{1}{4}\left(
%	\epsilon_i^2+\epsilon_a^2\right)^2}
%=\frac{\delta_x^2\tan(\delta_z)}
%{\delta_z+\frac{\epsilon_i^2+\epsilon_a^2}{2}\tan(\delta_z)}
%\]
%or
\begin{equation}
\label{DispSysIntModesab}
\delta_z/\tan(\delta_z)+\frac{\epsilon_i^2+\epsilon_a^2}{2}
\approx
\frac{\epsilon_a^2}{1
	+\left(\delta_z^2+\frac{1}{4}\left(
	\epsilon_i^2+\epsilon_a^2\right)^2\right)/\delta_x^2}
%=\frac{\delta_x^2\tan(\delta_z)}
%{\delta_z+\frac{\epsilon_i^2+\epsilon_a^2}{2}\tan(\delta_z)}
\end{equation}
Since the right-hand side of \ref{DispSysIntModesab} is small (bounded by $\epsilon_a^2$), $\delta_z/\tan(\delta_z)$ has to be small and thus the vertical wavenumber $\delta_z$ is close to $\pi/2+m\pi$, with $m\in\mathbb{N}$.
%
Again, in order to get a more accurate expression of $\delta_z$, we equate the (inversed) squared frequency given by the surface dispersion relation \ref{EqFullDisperb} to the (inversed) $\omega_-^2$, given by the inner dispersion relation \ref{solseq}, and perform the nonlinear equation's solution approximation followed by a Taylor development in $\epsilon_i, \epsilon_a$ to obtain:
\begin{equation}
	\label{ParamallMAM1}
\begin{array}{l}
\displaystyle
\delta_{z}(\delta_x)=\delta_{z,mam}(\delta_x)=
\delta_{z,m}
-\frac{(\delta_x^2-\delta_{z,m}^2)}{2\delta_{z,m}(\delta_x^2+\delta_{z,m}^2)}\epsilon_a^2
+\frac{\epsilon_i^2}{
2\delta_{z,m}^2}
\\[5mm]
\hspace*{1cm}
\displaystyle
\underbrace{
-\frac{\delta_x^6(\epsilon_a^2-\epsilon_i^2)^2+3\delta_x^2(\epsilon_a^2-\epsilon_i^2)^2\delta_{z,m}^2-\delta_x^2(5\epsilon_a^2-3\epsilon_i^2)(\epsilon_a^2+\epsilon_i^2)\delta_{z,m}^4+(\epsilon_a^2+\epsilon_i^2)^2\delta_{z,m}^6}{4(\delta_x^2+\delta_{z,m}^2)^3\delta_{z,m}^3}
}_{\mathrm{O}	((\epsilon_i^2+\epsilon_a^2)^2)}
\\[5mm]
\hfill
\displaystyle
+\mathrm{O}	((\epsilon_i^2+\epsilon_a^2)^3)
\end{array}
\end{equation}
An expansion  for the frequency $\omega^2$ can be obtained by injecting the expression \ref{ParamallMAM1} of $\delta_z$ in the general expression \ref{DispAcousDT} in the unbounded domain case.
The main departure from to the usual acoustic wave frequency, given in Table \oldref{TableWave solutions} in dimensional form, is given by the second-order development:
\begin{equation}
	\label{ParamallMAM2}
	\omega^2(\delta_x) =\omega_{mam}^2(\delta_x)=
	\frac{1}{\epsilon_a^2}
	\left[	\delta_x^2+\delta_{z,m}^2-\frac{(\delta_x^2-\delta_{z,m}^2)}{(\delta_x^2+\delta_{z,m}^2)}\epsilon_a^2+
	\epsilon_i^2
	\right]
		+\mathrm{O}	((\epsilon_i^2+\epsilon_a^2))
\end{equation}
Here, stratification has a first-order (in $\epsilon_i^2$) contribution to the modification of the homogeneous case frequency. This first-order modification comes from the first-order modification on the vertical wavenumber itself \ref{ParamallMAM1}. However, it is clear that the associated impact is small since $\epsilon_i^2$ is negligible compared with $\delta_{z,m}^2$ in \ref{ParamallMAM1} and \ref{ParamallMAM2}, because $\delta_{z,m} \ge \pi/2$. A similar conclusion was drawn in \cite{smith_2015}.

\subsection{Purely imaginary $\delta_z$: surface acoustic-gravity waves}
\label{SubSectionGraphicMSW}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%In the present section, these approximations are plotted on figure \ref{Fig_Approx}to be compared with the correction numerical approximation obtained in Section \ref{SectionGraphic}.
"Surface waves" generally refer to wave propagating horizontally as anomalies of the ocean free-surface \citep{gill_1982}. In the vertical direction, these surface wave anomalies are "evanescent", meaning that, with the notation chosen in the present study, the vertical wavenumber $\delta_z$ is a purely imaginary complex number.
%An alternative way to introduce "surface waves" is to introduce them as a limiting case of internal gravity mode (Duckowicz, 2015): they are then referred to as a barotropic mode with mode-number "n = 0" (using the notations of Section \ref{SectionGraphic}).\\
%The numerical investigation of long MSW conducted in the previous subsection indicates that these two characterizations refer to two different wave solutions.\\
A MSW defined by its triplet $(\delta_x,\ \delta_z,\ \omega)$ must satisfy both the inner \ref{EqFullDispera} and boundary \ref{EqFullDisperb} dispersion relations for $\delta_z\ =\ i\ \delta_{z,i}$:
%A consequence is that the dispersion relations of these horizontally propagating waves, should, at least locally in phase space, be advantageously parameterized in the form $(\ \delta_{z,i}(\delta_x),\ \omega(\delta_x)\ )$. As already stated before, such a parametrization is yet difficult to formulate since (i) the inner dispersion relation is fourth order in $\omega$ and (ii) the boundary dispersion relation is transcendental in $\delta_z$. A consequence is that analytically-simple, physically meaningful formulations can only be obtained under (very) restrictive assumptions.\\ 
%A way to circumvent these difficulties is to iteratively approximate and substitute $\delta_z(\delta_x)$ and $\omega(\delta_x)$ using both the inner and boundary dispersion relations.\\
\begin{equation}
\delta_x^2-\delta_{z,i}^2 =\epsilon_i^2\frac{\delta_x^2}
{\omega^2}+\epsilon_a^2\omega^2-\frac{(\epsilon_a^2+\epsilon_i^2)^2}{4} \qquad , \qquad
%\label{eqinternecomplexe}
%\end{equation}
%and the surface boundary relation \ref{EqFullDisperb}:
%\begin{equation}
\omega^2=\frac{\delta_x^2}
{\frac{\delta_{z,i}}{\tanh(\delta_{z,i})}+\frac{\epsilon_a^2+\epsilon_i^2}{2}}
%\label{eqsurfacecomplex}
\label{rappel-eqs-complex}
\end{equation}
In an homogeneous and incompressible ocean ($\epsilon_i=\epsilon_a=0$), we find $\delta_{z,i}=\delta_x$. This equality is often postulated in textbooks to reduce the number of variables. Vertical polarization relations are then functions of $\delta_x$ only \citep{gill_1982} and, as a consequence, the only remaining dispersion relation is the boundary dispersion relation \ref{EqFullDisperb} for purely imaginary vertical wavenumber $(\delta_z=i\delta_x)$, or its approximation  $\omega^2=\delta_x \tanh \delta_x$. In this case, $\delta_{z,i}$ is reduced to a vertical length-scale of energy decay with increasing distance from the surface; for very long waves ($\delta_x \gg 1$), the surface wave is approximately depth-independent.
%
\paragraph{Surface waves existence} In the more general case (non homogeneous and compressible ocean), it is first necessary to study the existence of solutions to \ref{rappel-eqs-complex}. Let us define
$f(\delta_x, \delta_{z,i})$ by:
\[
f(\delta_x, \delta_{z,i})=\delta_x^2-\delta_{z,i}^2-\left(
\epsilon_i^2\frac{\delta_x^2}
{\omega^2}+\epsilon_a^2\omega^2-\frac{(\epsilon_a^2+\epsilon_i^2)^2}{4}
\right),
\qquad \mbox{ with }\omega^2=\frac{\delta_x^2}
{\frac{\delta_{z,i}}{\tanh(\delta_{z,i})}+\frac{\epsilon_a^2+\epsilon_i^2}{2}}
\]
The inner boundary relation translates into $f(\delta_x,\delta_{z,i})=0$. It is easy to check that, for a given $\delta_{z,i}$, $f(\delta_x,\delta_{z,i})$ is an increasing function of $\delta_x$\footnote{This simple demonstration requires the assumption $\epsilon_a^2 \le 2 + \epsilon_i^2$, i.e., the same used in appendix to prove that the imaginary part of $\delta_z^2$ is zero.}. Let $\delta_{x,0}$ be the value of $\delta_x$ defined by $f(\delta_{x,0},\delta_z=0)=0$ ($\delta_{x,0}$ will be given in \ref{deltazsurface}, and is close to $\epsilon_i$).
In particular, we have $f(\delta_x,0)\le f(\delta_{x,0},0)=0$ for $\delta_x \le \delta_{x,0}$. It is also easy to verify that for a given $\delta_x$ such that $\delta_x \le \delta_{x,0}$, the maximum of $f(\delta_x,\delta_z)$ is attained in $\delta_{z,i}=0$. This proves that if $\delta_x < \delta_{x,0}$, $f(\delta_x,\delta_{z,i}) < 0\; \forall \delta_{z,i}$. Therefore, modified surface waves can only exist under the condition $\delta_x \ge \delta_{x,0}$.
%
\paragraph{Dispersion relation}
%The surface dispersion relation helps us to bound the magnitude of the right-hand side of the inner dispersion relation. Indeed, for $\delta_{z,i}\ge 0$, using, e.g., $\displaystyle \frac{\delta_{z,i}+1}{2}\le \frac{\delta_{z,i}}{\tanh(\delta_{z,i})}\le \delta_{z,i}^2+1$, we get
%\[
%\epsilon_i^2\frac{\delta_x^2}{\omega^2}\le \epsilon_i^2\left(\delta_{z,i}^2+1+\frac{\epsilon_a^2+\epsilon_i^2}{2})\right), \qquad \epsilon_a^2\omega^2 \le 2\epsilon_a^2\delta_x^2
%\]
%and thus we have
%\[
%-\frac{(\epsilon_a^2+\epsilon_i^2)^2}{4}\le \delta_x^2 - \delta_{z,i}^2 \le \epsilon_i^2 \delta_{z,i}^2+2\epsilon_a^2\delta_x^2
%+\epsilon_i^2\left(1+\frac{(\epsilon_a^2+\epsilon_i^2)}{2}\right)
%\]
%
It can be shown that $\displaystyle 1\le \frac{\delta_{z,i}}{\tanh(\delta_{z,i})}\le \delta_{z,i}^2+1, \quad \forall \delta_{z,i}\in\mathbb{R}$. Injecting these two inequalities in the surface dispersion relation leads to:
\[
\frac{\delta_x^2}{\omega^2}\le \delta_{z,i}^2+1+\frac{\epsilon_a^2+\epsilon_i^2}{2}, \qquad \hbox{and}\qquad \omega^2 \le \delta_x^2
\]
%
Since the inner dispersion relation implies 
$\displaystyle
-\frac{(\epsilon_a^2+\epsilon_i^2)^2}{4}\le \delta_x^2 - \delta_{z,i}^2 
\le \epsilon_i^2\frac{\delta_x^2}
{\omega^2}+\epsilon_a^2\omega^2$, we finally get:
%
\[
-\frac{(\epsilon_a^2+\epsilon_i^2)^2}{4}\le \delta_x^2 - \delta_{z,i}^2 
\le \epsilon_i^2 \delta_{z,i}^2+\epsilon_a^2\delta_x^2
+\epsilon_i^2\left(1+\frac{\epsilon_a^2+\epsilon_i^2}{2}\right)
\]
%
Using the smallness of the parameters $\epsilon_a$ and $\epsilon_i$, we can then conclude that $\delta_{z,i}^2$ is indeed close to $\delta_x^2$. 
%
The crude  assumption $\delta_{z,i} \approx \delta_x$ is sufficiently accurate to recover usual swell-like approximations (Table \oldref{TableWave solutions}), i.e., for sufficiently large $\delta_x$ (or $\delta_z$). However a more accurate expression is given by:
%
\begin{equation}
\delta_{z,i}^2=\delta_x^2
-\delta_x\left(
\epsilon_i^2/\tanh(\delta_x)+\epsilon_a^2\tanh(\delta_x)
\right)
+\mathrm{O}	((\epsilon_i^2+\epsilon_a^2)^2).

%\epsilon_i^2/\tanh(\delta_x)
%\right)
%+\mathrm{O}	(\epsilon_i^4).
%\end{equation}

In order to obtain \ref{longMSW}, we introduce the frequency given by the boundary dispersion relation in the inner dispersion relation (see \ref{rappel-eqs-complex}) and solve the resulting nonlinear equation by performing one pass of a Newton algorithm. Note that the problem is formulated in terms of $\delta_{z,i}^2(\delta_x)$ since it can be shown (by looking at the error estimate of the Newton algorithm) that a formulation in terms of $\delta_{z,i}(\delta_x)$ is not accurate when $\delta_x$ is relatively small.
Note also that \ref{longMSW} requires $\delta_x \ge \epsilon_i$ for $\delta_{z,i}^2$ to be positive. This is consistent with the fact that $\delta_x$ must be greater than $\delta_{x,0} (\approx \epsilon_i)$, as previously shown. However \ref{longMSW} does not allow us to recover the exact value $\delta_{x,0}$ of $\delta_x$ that cancels $\delta_{z,i}$, due to the first-order only approximation in terms of $(\epsilon_i^2+\epsilon_a^2)$. The case of long surface waves with $\delta_{z,i}$ close to zero will be treated separately in  subsection \oldref{SubSectionLongWavesrealdz}.
\\
The corresponding frequency is well approximated by:
%
\begin{equation}
\omega^2=\delta_x \tanh(\delta_x)
\left[1-\frac{1}{2}\left(
\epsilon_i^2/\sinh(\delta_x)^2+\epsilon_a^2/\cosh(\delta_x)^2-\epsilon_i^2/(\delta_x\sinh(\delta_x)\cosh(\delta_x)
\right)
\right]+\mathrm{O}	((\epsilon_i^2+\epsilon_a^2)^2)

%
For very short waves ($\delta_x \gg 1$), these relations simplify to:
\[
\delta_{z,i}\approx \delta_x
-\frac{1}{2}\left(
\epsilon_i^2+\epsilon_a^2
\right)

\omega^2\approx \delta_x

and we recover the frequency of short non hydrostatic waves $\omega^2 = \delta_x$ (or $\Omega=\sqrt{gk_x}$ in dimensional form) with a slightly modified vertical wavenumber.

%
\subsection{Long waves}
\label{SubSectionLongWavesrealdz}
Here, we perform specific developments for long waves where the vertical profile is almost depth-independent $\delta_z \approx 0$, $\delta_z$ being either real or pure imaginary.
Inserting the boundary dispersion relation \ref{EqFullDisperb} into the inner dispersion relation \ref{EqFullDispera} and making a second-order Taylor expansion in $\delta_z$ leads to:
\begin{equation}
	\delta_z^2=\left(
	\delta_{x,0}^2-\delta_x^2
	\right)
	\frac{1-\frac{\epsilon_a^2}{1+(\epsilon_i^2+\epsilon_a^2)/2}}{1+\epsilon_i^2/3-\frac{\delta_x^2}{3(1+(\epsilon_a^2+\epsilon_i^2)/2)^2}\epsilon_a^2}+\mathrm{O}(\delta_z^4)
\qquad\hbox{with }
\delta_{x,0}^2
=
\frac{\epsilon_i^2+(\epsilon_i^4-\epsilon_a^4)/4}{1-\frac{\epsilon_a^2}{1+(\epsilon_i^2+\epsilon_a^2)/2}}
\approx \epsilon_i^2
	\label{deltazsurface}
\end{equation}

%\nhi{
%\begin{equation}
%\delta_z^2=\left(
%\delta_{x,0}^2-\delta_x^2

%	\qquad\hbox{with }
%	\delta_{x,0}^2

%
$\delta_{x,0}$ is the value of $\delta_x$ for which $\delta_z=0$ is a solution of the inner and boundary dispersion relations. At first order in $(\epsilon_i^2+\epsilon_a^2)$, $\delta_{x,0}$ is equal to $\epsilon_i$.
The corresponding frequency can be obtained by inserting the approximation of the vertical wavenumber given by \ref{deltazsurface} into the boundary relation dispersion \ref{EqFullDisperb}. An approximation at second order in $\delta_x^2$ and $(\epsilon_i^2+\epsilon_a^2)$ is:
\begin{equation}
	\omega^2 = \delta_x^2 \left(
	1
	-\frac{1}{6}\left(

\paragraph{$\boldsymbol{\delta_x \le \delta_{x,0}}$: barotropic mode}
For $\delta_x \le \delta_{x,0} \approx \epsilon_i$, $\delta_z$ given by \ref{deltazsurface} is real. This implies that $\omega^2 \approx \delta_x^2 \le \epsilon_i\, \delta_x \le \frac{\epsilon_i}{\epsilon_a}\delta_x$ (since $\epsilon_a < 1$) and, thus, using the bounds on $\omega_-^2, \omega_+^2$ given by \ref{boundedomega2}, that these waves are always issued from the internal-wave branch ($\omega_-^2$), not from the acoustic-wave branch ($\omega_+^2$). In other words, there is no intersection between the boundary dispersion relation and the (real) acoustic-wave branch for $\delta_z$ close to zero.
These waves can be seen as the barotropic mode ($n=0$) solution of the internal gravity-wave branch. As noted by \cite{dukowicz_2013}, this mode, as higher internal modes, has its frequency $\omega^2$ approximately bounded by $\epsilon_i^2$ (i.e. $\Omega \le N$), since $\omega^2 \approx \delta_x^2 \le \epsilon_i^2$.
%
\paragraph{$\boldsymbol{\delta_x \ge \delta_{x,0}}$: long surface waves}
For $\delta_x \ge \delta_{x,0}$ (but still small), $\delta_z$ given by \ref{deltazsurface} is purely imaginary. These long waves originate from the surface-wave branch.
When $\delta_x$ increases, \ref{deltazsurface} converges to \ref{longMSW} (see Fig. \ref{dzdx}), which is a better approximation for medium and short surface waves.
Figure \oldref{dz2dx} shows $\delta_z^2$ as a function of $\delta_x$ (for $\delta_x \le 2\epsilon_i \approx 0.04$ ). The two approximations given by \ref{deltazsurface}, accurate for long waves, and \ref{longMSW}, accurate for medium/short waves, are plotted. On Figure \oldref{dzdx}, the modulus of the vertical wavenumber is shown on a larger interval for $\delta_x$ ($\delta_x \le 4\epsilon_i \approx 0.08$).
\begin{figure}[h]

The blue curve is the accurate approximation for long waves given by \ref{deltazsurface}, while the dashed orange curve is the approximation of surface waves given by \ref{longMSW}, which is more accurate for medium/short surface waves. An exact solution can be numerically computed (not shown) and is visually not distinguishable from the blue curve (accurate approximation for long waves).}

Figure \oldref{omegadx} presents the frequency $\omega$ as a function of the horizontal wavenumber $\delta_x$ according to different approximations. $\omega_{\mbox{\tiny Long Waves}}$ and $\omega_{\mbox{\tiny Medium Short Waves}}$ are computed by inserting the corresponding approximations \ref{deltazsurface} and \ref{longMSW} of $\delta_z$ in the boundary dispersion relation \ref{EqFullDisperb}. $\omega=\delta_x$ (resp. $\omega=\sqrt{\delta_x}$) represents the classical long shallow-water waves (resp. short non-hydrostatic surface waves) approximation. $\omega=\sqrt{\delta_x \tanh(\delta_x)}$ is the frequency of an homogeneous and incompressible (non hydrostatic) ocean. Unsurprisingly, this last approximation is accurate over the full range of horizontal wavenumbers, even for the set of compressible stratified equations. Indeed, even if for long waves, $\delta_z$ is not directly linked to $\delta_x$ (in particular $\delta_z$ does not vanish for $\delta_x \approx 0$), $\delta_z$ remains small (less than $\epsilon_i$) and thus $\delta_z/\tan(\delta_z)$ is close to 1.

\paragraph{Remark on Lamb Waves and surface acoustic-gravity waves}
In \ref{GPE}, horizontally propagating acoustic waves (Lamb Waves) have been discarded due to the existence of the free surface boundary condition which links the evolution of the surface pressure with the vertical velocity. If, instead of a free surface, a rigid lid boundary condition is imposed, Lamb waves are recovered and replace the surface waves studied above: while in an incompressible ocean, the rigid lid assumption modifies the barotropic external wave in a wave with an infinite speed, in a compressible ocean, its transforms a surface wave in a Lamb wave.  Also note that in the rigid lid case, both the internal and acoustic modes have a vertical wavenumbers given by $\delta_{z,n} = n\pi, \delta_{z,m} = m\pi$.\\
In the general case of a free surface boundary condition, there are similarities between surface waves and Lamb waves: their frequencies lie between those of internal and acoustic modes and they are vertically evanescent.

%\cite{Garret1969}
%\subsection{Close-to-singular MSW}
%
%The condition for propagation $(\displaystyle R^2(\delta_x,\delta_z)\le \frac{1}{4})$ derived in Section \ref{SubSectionFactoDisp} has so far been left out since for pulsations $\omega$ to remain real in the inner dispersion relation \ref{EqFullDispera}, it must necessarily be satisfied.  This condition is automatically satisfied for real horizontal and vertical wave-numbers but not necessarily for pure-imaginary vertical wave-numbers.\\
%A further question is to figure out if the resulting MSW wave solutions can or cannot approach and enter a region of the $(\delta_x,\ \delta_z,\ \omega)$ space where this condition is not satisfied. This would indeed lead to a pair of complex roots to \ref{solseq} and as a consequence to a wave solution diverging in time. Figure \ref{FigDelta} partially answers the question since it shows that the inner dispersion surface for pure-imaginary $\delta_z$ does not intersect the vertical (green) plane but remains tangent to it. We can show that the vertical component of the normal to the inner dispersion surface (i.e. $\partial$\ref{EqFullDisperai} $/\partial \omega$ ) vanishes for:
%\begin{equation}
%	   %\label{ParamAcousModes2}
%		\label{EqTurnPoints}
%		 \delta_x^2 - \delta_{z,i} ^2 
%		+\frac{(\epsilon_i^2+\epsilon_a^2)^2}{4}
%		-2 \epsilon_a^2 \omega^2 = 0
%\end{equation}

%	\label{FigDelta}
%\end{figure}
%
%
%This set of points of the inner dispersion surface satisfies $\displaystyle R^2(\delta_x,i \delta_{z,i})= \frac{1}{4}$ and, as a consequence,
%$\omega^2=\omega_a^2/2$. They correspond to the black line on Figure \ref{FigDelta}. This line separates the inner dispersion surface in two parts: the upper acoustic region $(\omega^2\approx\omega_a^2)$ closer to the MAM branch and the lower region $(\omega^2\approx\omega_i^2)$ closer to the MIM region.\\
%If solutions to \ref{EqTurnPoints} and \ref{EqFullDisperai} can be found, at least one MSW wave intersects this line of points in phase-space. Such an intersection exists if there exist at least one point belonging to the boundary dispersion surface given by \ref{EqFullDisperb} or equivalently if the system of equations \ref{EqTurnPoints}, \ref{EqFullDisperai} and \ref{EqFullDisperb} has a solution. Only one single point satisfies this system, it is indicated by a large red dot on \ref{FigDelta}. Its horizontal and vertical wave-numbers can be expressed as functions of its pulsation:
%\begin{subequations}
%	\begin{alignat}{2}	
%	   \label{ParamSolDelta}
%	   &\delta_{z,i}(\omega) && =\frac{1}{2} 
%	   \sqrt{(\epsilon_i^2+\epsilon_a^2)^2 
%	   - 8 \epsilon_a^2 \omega^2
%	   + 4 \frac{\epsilon_a^2}{\epsilon_i^2} \omega^4}\\[3mm]
%	   &\delta_x(\omega) &&=\omega
%	   \sqrt{\frac{\epsilon_a^2+\epsilon_i^2}{2}
%	   +\delta_{z,i}(\omega)\ coth(\delta_{z,i}(\omega))}
%	\end{alignat}
%\end{subequations}
%The pulsation $\omega$ must then be a solution of the (transdental) equation inherited from the inner dispersion relation \ref{EqFullDisperai}:
%\begin{subequations}
%	\begin{alignat}{2}	
%	   \label{ParamSolDelta2}
% 		\delta_x^2(\omega)-\delta_{z,i}^2(\omega) 
% 		-\epsilon_i^2\ \frac{\delta_x^2(\omega)}
% 			{\omega^2}-\epsilon_a^2\omega^2
% 		+\frac{\epsilon_a^2+\epsilon_i^2}{4} = 0
%	\end{alignat}
%\end{subequations}
%For the parameters $\epsilon_i$ and $\epsilon_a$ given in Table \ref{TableParameters}, this latter equation has only one solution for $\omega^*$ satisfying the system of equations \ref{EqTurnPoints}, \ref{EqFullDisperai} and \ref{EqFullDisperb}. It can be evaluated numerically:
%\begin{equation}
%	\omega_* \approx 0.154
%\end{equation}
%Orders of magnitude of the wave-numbers $(\delta_{x,*},\ \delta_{z,*})$ and pulsations $(\omega_*)$ are given in Table \ref{TableOrdersMag}. The resulting wave solution is a MSW wave that satisfies $R^2(\delta_{x,*},\ \delta_{z,*})=1/4$. Graphically this means that the solution point (in red) belongs to the line of points with horizontal normal vector or vanishing vertical gradient with respect to $\omega$. Dynamically, this means that the corresponding wave solution is "on the edge" and that for a small variation of the wave-number, of the pulsation or one the parameters it may enters in the region of unstable waves satisfying $R^2>1/4$. \\
%Other reference parameters given in Table \ref{TableParameters} remaining constant, Table \ref{TableOrdersMag} shows that when changing the depth of the reference ocean (4000 m) to only 10 m, the (normalized) pulsation $\omega_*$ remains quasi-constant and, as a consequence, the pulsation $\Omega_*$ varies approximately with $0.154 \sqrt{g/H}$ in this range of parameters ($\Omega_*$ decreases thus from $12\ mn$ to only $41.3\ s$).


\subsection{Summary: waves solutions in a bounded ocean}
\label{summarybounded}
In section \ref{SectionInner} on waves in an unbounded ocean,
we have seen that for the case of real vertical wavenumber ({\it vertically propagating waves}) \ref{realwavenumber}
internal and acoustic waves are well separated except for long waves ($\delta_z \approx 0$). We have here studied the consequences of the added surface dispersion relation.\\
At low frequency, modified internal gravity modes (MIM) have their frequencies bounded by above by the buyoancy frequency $\omega_- \le \omega_{c,i} = \epsilon_i$ (i.e. $\Omega_{c,i}=N$). $\omega_{c,i}$ is the internal cut off frequency. Compressibility effects on internal-gravity modes (MIM) are negligible \ref{SubSectionGraphicMIW}. In comparison with the textbook rigid lid approximated dispersion relation of MIM, the free surface boundary condition brings a small modification to their vertical wavenumbers and associated frequencies.\\
At high frequency, modified acoustic modes (MAM) have their frequencies bounded by below by the acoustic cut-off frequency $\omega_{c,a}$, $\omega_+ \ge \omega_{c,a}$ with is attained in the case of a bounded ocean for $\delta_x=0, \delta_z=\pi/2$ and writes $\omega_{c,a}^2=\frac{1}{\epsilon_a^2}\left((\pi/2)^2+\epsilon_a^2+\epsilon_i^2\right)$ (which is found by minimizing values of $\omega$ satisfying Eq. \oldref{ParamallMAM2}) (or $\Omega_{c,a}^2=\left(\frac{c_s}{H}\right)^2\left(\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)^2+\epsilon_a^2+\epsilon_i^2\right)$). Again, stratification effects are small and the lowest order modification from the usual dispersion relation comes from the presence of a free surface boundary condition.
\\
The free surface branch, which corresponds to pure imaginary wavenumber ({\it vertically evanescent waves}), has been described in section \ref{SubSectionGraphicMSW}. Here the acoustic and internal gravity branches are not well separated. When frequency is increased, modified surface waves (MSW) can change from surface waves modified by stratification to surfaces waves modified by compressibility. The crossing point is attained when $\omega^2=\frac{\epsilon_i}{\epsilon_a}\delta_x$. For the case of the bounded ocean here, only one triplet $\left(\delta_{x,\star}, \delta_{z,\star}, \omega_\star\right)$ can satisfy this relation. Since for free surface waves, $\omega^2$ is well approximated by $\omega^2=\delta_x\tanh(\delta_x)$, this neutral point exist only when $\exists \delta_x$ s.t. $\tanh(\delta_x)\approx \frac{\epsilon_i}{\epsilon_a}$ which requires $\epsilon_i \le \epsilon_a$. When $\epsilon_i \ge \epsilon_a$, the free surface waves branch always issues from the internal gravity wave branch. We also have noted that in a rigid lid approximation where this family of surface waves cannot exist, they are replaced by Lamb waves with a frequency of $\Omega=c_sk_x$.

The case of long waves ($\delta_z \approx 0$) have been addressed in details separately \ref{SubSectionLongWavesrealdz}. The interplay between compressibility, stratification and free surface is more pronounced here. There is a transition between the vertically propagating barotropic mode (LMIM) for very long horizontal waves to vertically evanescent surface waves for higher horizontal wavenumbers (LMSW). This transition has been fully characterized and occurs at a point where $\delta_x=\delta_{x,0}\approx \epsilon_i$ given by \ref{deltazsurface} and where the frequency is closed to the maximum value of internal waves $\Omega \approx N$.

\textit{Orders of magnitudes:}\\
 Orders of magnitudes for the characteristic horizontal/vertical length scales and frequencies introduced above are given in table \ref{TableOrdersMag} for the reference ocean (parameters of table \ref{TableParameters}), for a shallow ocean $H=10$m and for a strongly stratified ocean $N=10^{-2}$s$^{-1}$.

Table \oldref{TableWavesolutions_boundedmodified} summarizes the main results of this paper. Approximations for the different type of waves (acoustic, gravity and surface waves/modes) are indicated in their dimensional form. For sake of readability, some of the relations given in Table \oldref{TableWavesolutions_boundedmodified} are lower order versions of our derivations. They generally stem from first-order correction terms, compared with usual dispersion relations introduced in Table \oldref{TableWave solutions}. In that case, a red link to the higher approximation is given.\\
Corresponding analytical solutions for the vertical profiles of $u, w, p, \rho$ are given in Appendix \ref{solutionana}.
