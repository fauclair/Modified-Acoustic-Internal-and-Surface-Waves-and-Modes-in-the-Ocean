% Abstract
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\textit{Abstract:} Waves propagate in a free-surface ocean due to compressibility and gravity (and surface tension at much smaller scale). Analytical solutions have long been derived independently for acoustic and gravity waves, i.e., acoustic waves or internal-gravity rays in an unbounded ocean, surface-gravity waves in a free-surface-ocean, and acoustic or internal modes in a bounded ocean. In the present study, capillarity waves and earth-rotation are neglected and a simple, unified model based on inner and boundary dispersion relations is derived for waves propagating in a compressible, stratified, free-surface ocean. Wave solutions are identified and visually analyzed in phase-space. Taylor developments are then carried out with respect to small parameters describing stratification and compressibility and are compared with numerical approximations of the intersection of inner and boundary dispersion surfaces. Finally, the model recovers the known approximations for swell, long-surface waves, internal-gravity rays, internal modes, acoustic waves or acoustic modes, and also provides modification of these solutions due to stratification and compressibility.\\

\section{Introduction}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Many types of waves are known to propagate in the ocean, and textbooks \citep{LeBlond_Mysak_1981, gill_1982, Pedlosky_1982} have detailed the derivation of their analytical solutions for decades. These waves can be classified in several categories depending on the type of mechanisms directly involved in their propagation. Neglecting Earth's rotation and associated planetary waves, two fundamental categories are of particular interest in the present study: acoustic (sound) waves, which are a consequence of ocean compressibility, and gravity waves, which are sustained by the gravity force. Table \oldref{TableWave solutions} gives a short (and necessarily incomplete) list of such waves. A particular type of waves is most often characterized by a space-time dispersion relation, linking its time frequency (or period) with its space wavenumber (or wavelength). The phase and group velocities and wave dispersion capacity can be derived from the dispersion relations.

If ocean waves are short enough and generated far enough from the surface and bottom boundaries, they can propagate in the ocean as in any unbounded medium. However, when they are generated in the vicinity of these boundaries or when their wavelengths are large compared to the ocean depth, ocean waves are known to take specific forms, and the ocean basin is a \textit{wave-guide} propagating \textit{wave modes}. For example, the ocean stratification introduces internal gravity modes with "long" horizontal wavelengths. Another example are acoustic modes which are associated with compressibility effects and which have been recently re-discovered \citep{smith_2015}. Such internal and acoustic waves are qualified as "modes" since their vertical wavelength is constrained by the vertical extend of the domain. The ocean free-surface is permanently shaken by a myriad of horizontally propagating waves and it is not always clear whether these waves are modes or just vertically-evanescent edge-waves. Capillary waves, swells, tidal waves, tsunamis are well-known examples of such free surface waves.

Deriving a dispersion relation for acoustic waves or for internal wave rays in an unbounded ocean is rather straightforward. The method generally includes two steps: small amplitude is assumed; only specific wave-restoring mechanisms and medium characteristics are retained in the simplest possible wave dispersion model (compressibility and pressure force for acoustic waves, gravity and vertical advection of isopycnal surfaces for internal waves). The linear nature of the resulting model has two main advantages: analytical solutions can be derived and waves can be superimposed without interaction \citep{lighthill_1967}.

The introduction of free-surface brings more complexity. Small-amplitude is usually postulated in this case also and both gravity and free-surface motions are retained in the dispersion model. However, surface waves are "edge waves" propagating at the interface between the atmosphere and the ocean, and the surface kinematic relation (the free-surface general boundary condition) leads to a transcendental dispersion relation with trigonometric terms. As a result, deriving analytical solutions requires further simplifications. Specific analytical solutions can then be found in the literature depending, for example, on  relative depth, .i.e., the product of horizontal wavenumber $k_x$ and ocean depth $H$ (Table \oldref{TableWave solutions}). Long gravity wave solutions are a particular case of small $k_x H$, well-known to propagate horizontally with $\sqrt{g H}$ phase and group velocities (where $g$ is the acceleration of gravity).

%Such simplified models for small-amplitude waves are facing (at least) two severe limitations when compared to real-life ocean waves. Firstly, real ocean waves do not have an infinitesimal amplitude and finite-amplitude waves differ from their small-amplitude avatars: their non-linear growth can indeed lead to breaking or to new equilibrium when non-linearity can be counteracted by wave dispersion (propagating for instance as solitary waves). The second limitation comes from the fact that only specific wave-restoring mechanisms and medium characteristics are retained in process-oriented dispersion models whereas, in real ocean, compressibility can modify internal and surface waves and gravity can modify acoustic waves.
\newpage

The derivation of mixed acoustic-gravity waves in an ocean bounded by a free surface is even more challenging and is the central subject of this paper. The main objective is to specify the effect of compressibility and stratification on the preceding particular cases of wave solutions. Another target is to found analytical solutions to validate recent developments of the CROCO ocean model, resolving nonhydrostatic equations based on a pseudo-compressible approach \citep{AUCLAIR201812}.

\cite{dukowicz_2013} tackled this problem and proposed a review of \textit{"Various approximations in atmosphere and ocean models based on an exact treatment of gravity wave dispersion"}. In that paper, acoustic-gravity waves were shown to satisfy a system of two dispersion relations and the impact of several usual assumptions of ocean models was evaluated. The present study builds on Dukowicz's results and more specifically focuses on the impact of both stratification and compressibility on acoustic-gravity wave solutions: Taylor expansions of dispersion relations and resulting expressions for wavelength and frequency are derived in terms of compressibility and stratification. In addition:
\begin{itemize}
%	\item We show that, when the Boussinesq approximation is not made, free-surface boundary constraints can be recovered at the same order of precision as in Dukowicz's but using an Eulerian framework.
	%We do not intent to show that the Eulerian framework makes more physical sense than the Lagrangian framework but just that it can reduce the analytical burden.
	\item A systematic graphic analysis of wave solutions is proposed in 3D frequency/wavenumber phase-space, unfolding their dependency to the vertical wavenumber. The graphic presentation allows us to synthesize all possible connections between usual acoustic, internal and surface wave solutions.
	\item Surface waves are systematically studied together with internal and acoustic modes.
	\item Long-wave solutions are investigated in details in order to better understand from which solution branch they asymptotically derive; approximate parametric relations are derived for each type of wave.
%	\item A particular region of phase space is identified where surface acoustic-gravity surface wave are "structurally singular" in the sense that gravity and compressibility are both important and the corresponding wave solution is close to instability in time.
\end{itemize}

In the section \oldref{SectionLinModels}, a linear model of ocean wave propagation is proposed with bottom and surface boundary conditions, and a corresponding system of two dispersion relations (which will be called {\it inner} and {\it boundary} dispersion relations) is derived. The inner dispersion relation, which does not take into account the bottom and surface boundary conditions, is studied in details in Section \oldref{SectionInner}, and the wave solutions propagating in an unbounded ocean are investigated. Waves propagating in a bounded ocean, which also have to satisfy the boundary relation dispersion, are then studied in Section \oldref{SectionGraphic}. Conclusions are drawn in Section \oldref{SectionDiscussion}.

\section{Linear model for surface and internal acoustic-gravity waves}
\label{SectionLinModels}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{General model for a compressible, viscous ocean}
\label{SubSectionNSModel}

Ocean dynamics can be described with a small number of macroscopic variables: velocity $(\mathbf{v})$, pressure and density ($p$ and $\rho$), temperature and salinity ($T$ and $S$). In a Cartesian framework, the general equations governing the motion of a compressible, viscous ocean are then:

%
\begin{subequations}
 \begin{alignat}{2}
 \displaystyle
 %%%%%%%%%%%%%% Continuity %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 \label{NS_a} 
 & \frac{\partial\rho}{\partial t} &&= - \mathbf{\nabla}\cdot(\rho \mathbf{v})\\[3mm]  
 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Momentum %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 \label{NS_b}
	 & \frac{\partial \rho \mathbf{v}}{\partial t} 
	 &&= -\mathbf{\nabla}\cdot(\rho \mathbf{v}\otimes \mathbf{v}) 
	 -\mathbf{\nabla}p + 		
	\mathbf{\nabla}\cdot\underbrace{\left(
	\mu(\mathbf{\nabla}\mathbf{v}+\mathbf{\nabla}\mathbf{v}^{\ T})
 +\mu_2(\mathbf{\nabla}\cdot\mathbf{v})\ \mathbf{I}\ \right)}_{\mathbold{\tau}}
 +\rho \mathbf{g}\\
 %
 \label{NS_c}
 & \frac{\partial T}{\partial t} &&=-\mathbf{\nabla}\cdot(T\mathbf{v})
 +\mathbf{\nabla}\cdot\kappa_T\mathbf{\nabla}{T}\\[3mm]
 %
 \label{NS_d}
 & \frac{\partial S}{\partial t} &&=-\mathbf{\nabla}\cdot(S\mathbf{v})
 +\mathbf{\nabla}\cdot\kappa_S\mathbf{\nabla}{S}\\[3mm]
 \label{NS_e}
 & \rho &&= \rho(T,S,p)
 %
  \end{alignat}
\end{subequations}
%
where $\mathbf{I}$ is the identity matrix, superscript T indicates transposition, $\mu$ and $\mu_2$ are the kinetic and bulk (or second) viscosities, $\kappa_T$ and $\kappa_S$ are the heat and salt diffusivities. The first equations are written in a conservative form. They specify basic conservation principles: conservation of mass for Equation \ref{NS_a}, conservation of momentum for Equation \ref{NS_b} and conservation of heat and salt for equations \ref{NS_c} and \ref{NS_d}. Equation \ref{NS_e} is a functional relation describing the thermodynamic equation of state (EOS). 

\subsection{Surface and bottom boundary conditions}
\label{SubSectionBC}

At the bottom $(z=-H)$ and surface $(z=\zeta)$ of the ocean, boundary conditions must be specified for each variable (or for its derivatives). A simple condition of no penetration and no-slip at the ocean bottom can be written:
%
\begin{equation}
 \displaystyle
 \label{NS_BC0}
  \mathbf{v}(\mathbf{x_{\scriptscriptstyle H}},z=-H,t)=\mathbf{0}
\end{equation}
%
Neglecting surface-tension pressure drop, surface pressure is given by:
%
\begin{equation}
 \displaystyle
 \label{NS_BC1}
  p(\mathbf{x_{\scriptscriptstyle H}},z=\zeta,t)= p_{atm}
\end{equation}
%
with $p_{atm}$ the atmospheric pressure imposed at the surface of the ocean. Surface capillarity waves are consequently filtered out and will be neglected in the remaining of this work. The surface kinematic condition expresses the motion of the free-surface and relates the free-surface anomaly $\zeta$ to the surface vertical velocity $w$:
%
\begin{equation}
  \displaystyle
  \label{NS_BC2}
  \frac{\textrm{d}\zeta(\mathbf{x_{\scriptscriptstyle H}},t)}{\textrm{dt}}=w(\mathbf{x_{\scriptscriptstyle H}},z=\zeta,t)
\end{equation}
%
This kinematic boundary condition allows the propagation of surface gravity waves.

\subsection{Pressure and density decomposition and EOS simplification}
\label{SubSectionPRHO}

Waves are defined as small disturbances to a motionless thermodynamic equilibrium state, and both pressure and density can be decomposed into an equilibrium component and a small increment. In addition, as a first approximation, the impact of atmospheric pressure $p_{atm}$ can be neglected --- it can take an active part in wave generation, but only plays a minor role during propagation. 

The usual decomposition is now formalized for pressure \ref{decompoP_f} and density \ref{decompor_f}:
%
\begin{subequations}
  \begin{alignat}{2}
  % Pressure decomposition
  \displaystyle 
  \label{decompoP_f}
  \nonumber&p(\mathbf{x},t) &&= 
  \underbrace{\underbrace{p_{atm}
  (\mathbf{x_{\scriptscriptstyle H}},t)}_{\approx0}
  +g\int_z^{\zeta}\rho_{h}(\mathbf{x_{\scriptscriptstyle H}},z',t)\ dz'}_{p_h(\mathbf{x},t)}
  +\delta p(\mathbf{x},t)\\[3mm]
  & &&= \underbrace{
  \underbrace{g\int_z^{\zeta}{\displaystyle \hat{\rho}_h(z')}\ dz'}_{\hat{p}_h(z)}
  +\underbrace{g\int_z^{\zeta}{\left(\rho_{h}(\mathbf{x_{\scriptscriptstyle H}},z',t)-\hat{\rho}_h(z')\right)\ dz'}}
  _{p_h'(\mathbf{x},t)}}_{p_h(\mathbf{x},t)}
  +\, \delta p(\mathbf{x},t)\\[3mm]
  \label{decompor_f}  
  % Density decomposition
  \nonumber&\rho(\mathbf{x},t) &&=\underbrace{\hat{\rho}_{TS}(z)+\rho_{TS}'(\mathbf{x},t)}_{\rho_{TS}(\mathbf{x},t)=\rho(T,S,p=0)}
  +\underbrace{\frac{1}{c_s^{2}}\left(\hat{p}_h(z)+p_h'(\mathbf{x},t)+\delta p(\mathbf{x},t)\right)}_{\left.\partial \rho / \partial p\right|_{T,S}\ p(\mathbf{x},t)} 
  +\, \mathrm{O}((\delta p)^2)\\[3mm]
  & &&\approx\underbrace{\underbrace{\hat{\rho}_{TS}(z)
  +\frac{\hat{p}_h(z)}{c_s^{2}}}
  _{\hat{\rho}_h(z)}
  +\underbrace{\rho_{TS}'(\mathbf{x},t)
  +\frac{ p_h'(\mathbf{x},t) }{c_s^{2}}}_{\rho_h'(\mathbf{x},t)}  }
  _{\rho_h(\mathbf{x},t)}
  +\frac{\delta p(\mathbf{x},t)}{c_s^{2}}
  \end{alignat}
\end{subequations}
%
\noindent with $\left.\partial \rho / \partial p\right|_{T,S} = c_s^2$ at constant entropy, $\partial \hat{p}_h /\partial z = -\hat{\rho}_h(z) g$, $\partial p_h' /\partial z = -\rho_h'(z) g$.

The first decomposition $p=p_h+\delta p$ is defined by an hydrostatic component $p_h$ and a nonhydrostatic pressure increment $\delta p$. It is based on a division of the pressure field into a slow varying component in hydrostatic equilibrium and a fast varying nonhydrostatic component. Density can be decomposed in a similar way with $\rho_h$ the hydrostatic component and $\delta \rho=\delta p/c_s^2$ the non-hydrostatic increment. The hydrostatic component of the density can be further decomposed into a depth-dependent reference value $\hat{\rho}_h(z)$ and an increment $\rho'_h$, leading to a similar decomposition for the hydrostatic component of the pressure into a barotropic component $\hat{p}_h$ and a baroclinic increment $p'_h$.

The second decomposition focuses on compressibility: it can be viewed as a first-order approximation of the EOS with respect to the total pressure $p$. This Taylor development is carried out in the vicinity of the hydrostatic pressure and is first formulated for density. The decomposition $\rho=\rho_{TS}+p/c_s^2$ is based on a first-order decomposition with respect to total pressure $p$. The component $\rho_{TS}$ is a function of temperature and salinity and $p/c_s^2$ is the first-order compressibility increment due to total pressure. The EOS approximation \ref{NS_e} under this form $\rho=\rho_{TS}+p/c_s^2$ along with tracer conservation equations, omitting the diffusion terms, allows us to write:
%
\begin{equation}
	 \frac{\textrm{d}\rho}{\textrm{dt}}=
	\frac{1}{c_s^2}  \frac{\textrm{d} p}{\textrm{dt}}
\end{equation}
%
or using mass conservation:
%
\begin{equation}
	-\rho \nabla \cdot {\bf v} =
	\frac{1}{c_s^2}  \frac{\textrm{d} p}{\textrm{dt}}
	\label{EqEOSd}
\end{equation}
%
Without loss of generality, the present study can now be restricted to the $(O, x, z)$ vertical plan to simplify notations. Equation \ref{EqEOSd} can then be expanded to:
%
\begin{equation}
	- \rho \left(\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}
	+\frac{\partial w}{\partial z}
	\right)=
	\frac{1}{c_s^2}\left(\frac{\partial p}{\partial t} 
	 +u \frac{\partial p}{\partial x}
	 +w \frac{\partial p}{\partial z}\right)
	 \label{EqEOSd1}
\end{equation}
%
%At first order (XXX), the equation of state simplifies to:
%\begin{subequations}
%\begin{alignat}{2}
%	\label{EqEOS1}
%	\displaystyle 
%	 \frac{\partial\rho}{\partial t} 
%	 +w \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial z}=
%	 +\frac{1}{c_s^2}\left(\frac{\partial p}{\partial t} 
%	 +w \frac{\partial p}{\partial z}\right)
%\end{alignat}
%\end{subequations}

A Taylor expansion of model equations can now be carried out in the vicinity of the reference profiles $(\hat{p}_h(z),\ \hat{\rho}_h(z))$ and of a resting fluid ($u=w=0$). Small amplitude wave-induced increments are given by $\delta V\ =\ (p'_h+\delta p,\ \rho'_h+\delta p/c_s^2,\ u ,\ w)$. At first order in $\delta V$, conservation of mass and vertical advection of pressure and density can be rewritten. The left-hand side of \ref{EqEOSd1} becomes:
%
\[
- \rho \left(\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}
+\frac{\partial w}{\partial z}
\right)=
- \left(
\frac{\partial \hat{\rho}_{h} u}{\partial x}
+
\frac{\partial \hat{\rho}_{h} w}{\partial z}
- w \frac{\partial \hat{\rho}_{h} }{\partial z}
\right)
 +\mathrm{O}(\delta V^2)
\]
%
while the right-hand side of \ref{EqEOSd1} becomes:
%
\[
	\frac{1}{c_s^2}\left(\frac{\partial p}{\partial t} 
+u \frac{\partial p}{\partial x}
+w \frac{\partial p}{\partial z}\right)=
	\frac{1}{c_s^2}\left(\frac{\partial p}{\partial t} 
+w\frac{\partial \hat{p}_h}{\partial z}\right)+\mathrm{O}(\delta V^2)
=
	\frac{1}{c_s^2}\left(\frac{\partial p}{\partial t} 
-\hat{\rho}_h gw	\right)
+\mathrm{O}(\delta V^2)
\]
%
leading to:
%
\begin{equation}
 \frac{\partial p}{\partial t} =
 -c_s^{2}\left(\frac{\partial \hat{\rho}_h u}{\partial x}
 +\frac{\partial \hat{\rho}_h w}{\partial z}\right)
 +\underbrace{\left(g+\frac{c_s^2 \partial \hat{\rho}_h(z)/\partial z}{\hat{\rho}_h(z)}\right)}_{-c_s^2 N^2/g}
 \hat{\rho}_h w+\mathrm{O}(\delta V^2)
 \label{Eq_EOS1}
\end{equation}
%
where we have introduced $N^2(z)=-g\left(1/\hat{\rho}_h(z)\ \partial \hat{\rho}_h(z)/\partial z+g/c_s^2\right)$ the Brunt-V\"ais\"al\"a frequency for a compressible ocean (\citealt{gill_1982}, p169). By definition, $N^2$ is zero for an homogeneous ocean for which $\rho_{T,S}(\mathbf{x},t)=\rho_0$.

The free-surface variations are introduced through the surface boundary condition for pressure:
\[
 p(z=0) = \hat{\rho}_h(0)\, g\, \zeta+\mathrm{O}(\delta V^2)
\]
and the kinematic surface boundary condition can be written for pressure:
\[
 \frac{\rm{d}p}{\rm{dt}}(z=0)= g\, \hat{\rho}_h(0)\, w(z=0)+\mathrm{O}(\delta V^2)
\]

\subsection{Linear inviscid wave model}
\label{SubSectionLinModel}

Based on the pressure and density decomposition proposed in Section \oldref{SubSectionPRHO}, a simpler, inviscid, linear, rotation-less $p-\rho$ model can be used to model acoustic, internal and surface waves. At first order in wave-induced increment $\delta V$, the conservation of momentum and mass and the EOS read:
%
\begin{subequations}
  \begin{alignat}{2}
    \displaystyle
    \label{WM_a}
    % NS in x-direction:
     &\frac{\partial\hat{\rho}_h u}{\partial t} &&  = 
     -\frac{\partial p}{\partial x}\\[3mm]    
    \label{WM_b}
    % NS in z-direction:
    &\frac{\partial \hat{\rho}_h w}{\partial t} && = 
    -\frac{\partial p}{\partial z}-\rho g \\[3mm]
    \label{WM_c}
    %Continuity equation:
    &\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} && =  - \left(\frac{\partial \hat{\rho}_h u}{\partial x}+\frac{\partial \hat{\rho}_h w}{\partial z}\right) \\
    \label{WM_d}
    % State equation  or Pressure equation:
    & \frac{\partial p}{\partial t} &&=
 -c_s^{2}\left(\frac{\partial \hat{\rho}_h u}{\partial x}
 +\frac{\partial \hat{\rho}_h w}{\partial z}\right)
 -\left(c_s^2 N^2/g\right)  \hat{\rho}_h w
  \end{alignat}
\end{subequations}
%
with the (flat) bottom and surface conditions:
%
\begin{subequations}
  \begin{alignat}{2}
    \displaystyle
    \label{WM_bc_a}
  &w(z=-H) && =0 \\[3mm]
    \label{WM_bc_b}
  &\frac{\partial p}{\partial t}(z=0) && = \hat{\rho}_h\, g\, w(z=0)
  \end{alignat}
\end{subequations}
%
As in \cite{dukowicz_2013}, in the following, we will express part of the results in terms of $D(z)$, a vertical length scale associated with stratification, defined by $\displaystyle \frac{1}{D(z)}=\frac{N^2(z)}{g}+\frac{g}{c_s^2}$. The background stratification satisfies $\displaystyle \frac{\partial \hat{\rho}_h(z)}{\partial z}=-\frac{1}{D(z)}\, \hat{\rho}_h(z)$.

\subsection{General propagation equation and polarization}

\paragraph{Form of wave solutions}
Dispersion relations can be derived by postulating and specifying the wave form. Horizontally-propagating surface waves, wave modes propagating in the ocean wave guide, internal wave rays and acoustic waves all satisfy the following "polarization" relations:
\label{SubSectionPropag}
%
\begin{subequations}
  \begin{alignat}{2}
  \displaystyle
  \left(
  \begin{array}{c}
    \hat{\rho}_h u\\
    \hat{\rho}_h w\\
    \rho\\
    p
  \end{array}
  \right)
  =
  \left(
  \begin{array}{c}
    \widetilde{U}(z)\\
    \widetilde{W}(z)\\
    \widetilde{\rho}(z)\\
    \widetilde{p}(z)
  \end{array}
  \right)
  e^{i(k_xx-\Omega t)}
\end{alignat}
\end{subequations}
%
where $k_x$ and $\Omega$ are respectively the horizontal wavenumber and wave frequency.

\paragraph{Inner equations}
These relations can be introduced in the propagation model \ref{WM_a}-\ref{WM_d}. After some developments, an ordinary differential equation can be obtained for $\widetilde{W}(z)$:
%
\begin{equation}
  \displaystyle
  \widetilde{W}''(z)+\frac{1}{D(z)}\widetilde{W}'(z)
  +
  \left(
  k_x^2\frac{N^2-\Omega^2}{\Omega^2}+\frac{\Omega^2}{c_s^2}
  -\frac{D'(z)}{D^2(z)}
  \right)
  \widetilde{W}(z)=0
  \label{eqwfirst}
\end{equation}
%
with the following polarization relations:
% Label have been changed to use git-latexdiff
\begin{subequations}
    \label{POL_c}
	\begin{alignat}{2}
	\displaystyle
%	\label{POL_a}
	&\widetilde{U}(z) && =\displaystyle  -ik_x\,\frac{(c_s^2-gD(z))\, \widetilde{W}(z)+c_s^2D(z)\,\widetilde{W}'(z)}{D(z)\, (\Omega^2-c_s^2k_x^2)} \\[3mm]
%	\label{POL_b}
	&\widetilde{\rho}(z) &&=\displaystyle -i\, \frac{k_x^2\,(c_s^2-gD(z))\,\widetilde{W}(z)+\Omega^2D(z)\widetilde{W}'(z)}{D(z)\,\Omega\,(\Omega^2-c_s^2k_x^2)}\\[3mm]
%	\label{POL_c}
	&\widetilde{p}(z) &&=\displaystyle -i\Omega\, \frac{(c_s^2-gD(z))\, \widetilde{W}(z)+c_s^2D(z)\,\widetilde{W}'(z)}{D(z)\, (\Omega^2-c_s^2k_x^2)}
	\end{alignat}
\end{subequations}
%
To obtain this relation and in particular to eliminate its pressure dependence, one needs to exclude the possibility that:
%
\begin{equation}
    \displaystyle
   \Omega^2 =  c_s^2k_x^2 
   \label{lamb0}
\end{equation}
%
which is the dispersion relation for acoustic Lamb waves in the atmosphere \citep{apel_principles_1987}. As for the atmospheric case, it can be shown that these waves are characterized by $W(z)=0, P(z)=P_0\, e^{-g z/c_s^2}$. However, the surface boundary condition \ref{WM_bc_b} constrains $P_0$ to be zero and only the trivial null solution is obtained. Therefore, Lamb waves do not exist in the ocean and, as pointed out by several authors, they are replaced by surface gravity waves, discussed later.\bigskip\\
%
\textit{Stratification-induced change of variables}\\
To remove first-order terms and simplify future developments, the following change of variable can be made:
%
\begin{equation}
  \displaystyle
  \widetilde{W}(z)=\widetilde{W}(0)\, F(z)\, \exp\left(\int_{z}^0 \frac{{\rm d} z'}{2D(z')} \right) ,
  \label{CVF}
\end{equation}
with $F(0)=1$. Following \ref{eqwfirst}, the unknown function $F(z)$ satisfies:
%
\begin{equation}
  \displaystyle
  F''(z)
  +\left(
  k_x^2\frac{N^2-\Omega^2}{\Omega^2}
  +
  \frac{\Omega^2}{c_s^2}-\frac{1+2D'(z)}{4D(z)^2}
  \right)
  F(z)=0
  \label{eqF}
\end{equation}
%
$F(z)$ differs from the vertical momentum $\widetilde{W}(z)$ by the attenuation factor  $\exp\left(\int_{z}^0 \frac{{\rm d} z'}{2D(z')} \right)$. This factor reduces the vertical extent of wave anomalies based on the length scale $D(z)$. The stronger the stratification, the shorter $D(z)$ and this vertical extent.

\paragraph{Surface and bottom boundary conditions}
The polarization relations must also be substituted in the surface boundary condition \ref{WM_bc_b}, leading to:
%
\begin{equation}
  \displaystyle
  -i\Omega\, \widetilde{p}(0)=g \widetilde{W}(0)
\end{equation}
or, using \ref{POL_c},
\begin{equation}
  \displaystyle
  \widetilde{W}'(0)+\left(
  \frac{1}{D(0)}-\frac{gk_x^2}{\Omega^2}
  \right)\widetilde{W}(0)=0
  \label{surfacedisperrela}
\end{equation}
%
%while the simplified relation found in usual textbook (e.g. \cite{gill_1982}) is given by
%\begin{equation}
%\displaystyle
%\widetilde{W}'(0)-\left(
%\frac{gk_x^2}{\Omega^2}
%\right)\widetilde{W}(0)=0.
%\label{surfacedisperrela_tradi}
%\end{equation}\\
%
Note that \ref{surfacedisperrela} is identical to Eq. 71 of \cite{dukowicz_2013} who suggests that the term $1/D(0)$ can only result from governing equations formulated in a Lagrangian vertical coordinate to properly account for the surface boundary condition. Our result contradicts this statement since the term also appears in the Eulerian coordinate system when no incompressibility nor Boussinesq approximation is made.
%It is here evident that this term actually comes from the compressibility effects (i.e. not having replaced Eq. \ref{WM_c} by an incompressibility assumption which would have directly be translated into \ref{surfacedisperrela_tradi}) and is not linked to the choice of the vertical coordinate.\\ 

In terms of the unknown function $F(z)$, the surface boundary condition reads:
%
\begin{equation}
  \displaystyle
  F'(0)+\left(
  \frac{1}{2D(0)}-\frac{gk_x^2}{\Omega^2}
  \right)F(0)=0
  \label{eqFbc}
\end{equation}
%
The bottom boundary condition \ref{WM_bc_a} simply leads to:
%
\begin{equation}
  \displaystyle
  F(-H)=0
  \label{eqFbc2}
\end{equation}
\subsection{The constant Brunt-V\"ais\"al\"a frequency case}
 \label{SubSectionDisp}
In the rest of the paper, the Brunt-V\"ais\"al\"a frequency case is assumed to be constant: $N^2(z)=N_0^2$, or equivalently $D(z)= D(0)= D_0$. Equation \ref{CVF} can then be rewritten:
 %
 \begin{equation}
 \displaystyle
 \widetilde{W}(z)=\widetilde{W}(0)\, \exp\left(-\frac{z}{2D_0}\right)\,F(z)
 \label{CVF2}
 \end{equation}
 %
 and $\hat{\rho}_h(z)$ is given by $\hat{\rho}_h(z)=\hat{\rho}_h(0)\,e^{-z/D_0}$.
 The general expression of the vertical velocity perturbation profile for a constant scale height $D_0$ is thus:
 %
 \begin{equation}
 \displaystyle
 w(x,z,t)=\frac{1}{\hat{\rho}_h(z)}\widetilde{W}(z)\, e^{i(k_x x-\Omega t)}=\frac{\widetilde{W}(0)}{\hat{\rho}_h(0)}\, e^{z/2D_0}\, F(z)\, e^{i(k_x x-\Omega t)}
 \end{equation}
% \subsubsection{Dimensional dispersion relations}
The vertical profile $F(z)$ has to satisfy the following system of equations:
%
\begin{subequations}
	\label{EqDimF}
	\begin{alignat}{2}	
    \displaystyle
	\label{EqDimFa}
    F''(z)
    +
   \overbrace{ \left(k_x^2\frac{N_0^2-\Omega^2}{\Omega^2}
   +\frac{\Omega^2}{c_s^2}-\frac{1}{4D_0^2}\right)}^{\equiv\, k_z^2}
    F(z)=0\\[4mm]
    \displaystyle
    F(0)=1
    \label{EqDimFbb}
    \\[4mm]
	\label{EqDimFc}
    \displaystyle
    F(-H)=0
  \end{alignat}
\end{subequations}
The general solution of \ref{EqDimFa}- \ref{EqDimFbb}- \ref{EqDimFc} is
%
\begin{equation}
\label{EqDispRef}
\displaystyle
F(z)=\frac{\sin\left(k_z(H+z)\right)}{\sin(k_zH)}
\end{equation}
where the vertical wavenumber $k_z$ is defined in \ref{EqDimFa} and is a function of $k_x$ and $\Omega$.\\
Under the constant Brunt-V\"ais\"al\"a frequency assumption, the surface boundary condition \ref{eqFbc} reads:
\begin{equation}
F'(0)+\left(
\frac{1}{2 D_0}-\frac{gk_x^2}{\Omega^2}
\right) F(0)=0
\label{EqDimFb}
\end{equation}
%
\subsection{Inner and boundary dispersion relations}
The relation introduced in \ref{EqDimFa} between the vertical wavenumber $k_z$, horizontal wavenumber $k_x$ and wave frequency $\Omega$ constitutes the first dispersion relation. It is rewritten as:
\begin{equation}
  \label{EqDispRefInner}
  \displaystyle
  k_z^2+
   k_x^2\left(1-\frac{N_0^2}{\Omega^2}\right)
   -\frac{\Omega^2}{c_s^2}+\frac{1}{4D_0^2}=0
\end{equation}
%
This relation does not account for surface or bottom boundary conditions and thus only deals with the propagation of waves in the inner ocean. It will now be referred to as the \textit{inner} dispersion relation. The bottom boundary condition is accounted for in the general solution profile given by \ref{EqDispRef}.
Injecting this vertical profile $F(z)$ into the surface boundary condition \ref{EqDimFb} then leads to the \textit{boundary} dispersion relation:
%
\begin{equation}
	\label{EqDispRefs}
     \Omega^2 =\frac{gk_x^2 \tan(Hk_z)}{k_z +\frac{ \tan(Hk_z)}{2 D_0 }}
    =\frac{gk_x^2 }{\frac{1}{ 2 D_0} + k_z \cotan(Hk_z)}
\end{equation}
%
A wave propagating in a "bounded ocean" must satisfy both the \textit{inner} and \textit{boundary} (dimensional) dispersion relations \ref{EqDispRefInner} and \ref{EqDispRefs}. Note that the traditional inner and boundary dispersion relations for a Boussinesq, incompressible fluid \citep{gill_1982} can be recovered from \ref{EqDispRefInner} and \ref{EqDispRefs} by setting $c_s \rightarrow +\infty$ (incompressibility) and then $D_0 \rightarrow +\infty$ (incompressibility and Boussinesq approximations), leading to:
\[
\Omega^2=N^2\frac{k_x^2}{k_x^2+k_z^2}=gk_x^2\frac{\tan(Hk_z)}{k_z}
\]
\paragraph{Dimensionless dispersion relations}

As in \cite{dukowicz_2013}, two parameters are now defined to obtain dimensionless dispersion relations:
%
\begin{equation}
     \epsilon_i^2 =  \frac{N^2 H}{g} 
    ,\quad \epsilon_a^2 = \frac{g H}{c_s^2} 
\end{equation}
%
$\epsilon_i$ is thus a small parameter related to gravity, defined as the ratio of the order of magnitude of the first internal mode $N H$ to the velocity of long surface waves $\sqrt{gH}$. $\epsilon_a$ is a small parameter related to acoustics, defined as the ratio of the speed of long surface waves $\sqrt{gH}$ to that of sound waves $c_s$. The depth scale can then be rewritten as:
%
$D_0=H/(\epsilon_i^2+\epsilon_a^2)$.
%
Three dimensionless variables are also further defined:
%
\begin{equation}
\omega = \Omega \sqrt{\frac{H}{g}}
    ,\quad \delta_x = k_x H
    ,\quad \delta_z = k_z H
\end{equation}
%
%
The inner \ref{EqDispRefInner} and boundary \ref{EqDispRefs} dispersion relations can be written in terms of the dimensionless parameters as:
% Note that this scale-depth does not include any compressibility-induced correction and, as a consequence, it is a function of both small parameters $\epsilon_i$ and $\epsilon_a$. As a consequence the stratification scale-depth ratio $H/D_0=\epsilon_i^2+\epsilon_a^2$ gives an idea of the relative strength of the ocean stratification.\\
%A set of two dimensionless dispersion relations are thus eventually obtained:
%
\begin{subequations}
	\label{EqFullDisper}
	\begin{alignat}{2}	
	\label{EqFullDispera}
 		& \delta_x^2+\delta_z^2 &&=\epsilon_i^2\frac{\delta_x^2}
 			{\omega^2}+\epsilon_a^2\omega^2-\frac{(\epsilon_a^2+\epsilon_i^2)^2}{4}\\[3mm]
		\label{EqFullDisperb}
		& \omega^2 &&=\frac{\delta_x^2\tan(\delta_z)}
		{\delta_z+\frac{\epsilon_a^2+\epsilon_i^2}			{2}\tan(\delta_z)}
		%=\frac{\delta_x^2}{\frac{\epsilon_a^2+\epsilon_i^2}{2}
		%+\delta_z cotan(\delta_z)}
	\end{alignat}
\end{subequations}
%
%The first relation is the dispersion relation for the inner-ocean. It derives from equations \ref{WM_a} to \ref{WM_d}. The second one (hereafter the \textit{boundary dispersion relation}) is the dispersion relation deriving from the surface and bottom boundary conditions \ref{WM_bc_b}.\\
In a free-surface ocean, wave solutions must satisfy simultaneously relations \ref{EqFullDispera} and \ref{EqFullDisperb}. This means that only one parameter among the frequency $\omega$ and horizontal and vertical wavenumbers ($\delta_x$ and $\delta_z$) can be imposed. The other two parameters must be adjusted for the wave to satisfy the two dispersion relations. For short vertical wavenumbers and far from the bottom and surface boundaries, wave solutions only need to satisfy the inner dispersion relation and to be dynamically consistent. Pure acoustic waves or pure internal-gravity wave rays are known to propagate in the inner ocean as in an unbounded ocean.

The resulting set of two equations \ref{EqFullDispera}-\ref{EqFullDisperb} for the three variables $(\delta_x,\  \delta_z,\ \omega)$ and the two parameters $\epsilon_a, \epsilon_i$ is nonlinear, and simple general solutions cannot be found analytically. However much insight can be gained on these waves by a geometrical investigation of surfaces (in phase space) that correspond to the inner and boundary dispersion relations. 
%Indeed, in $(\delta_x,\  \delta_z,\ \omega)$ phase-space, the inner and boundary dispersion relations are respectively given by two surfaces. When these two surfaces intersect, points lying on the intersection are triplets of wave solutions.
These surfaces will respectively be named \textit{inner and boundary dispersion surfaces}.

In the following, we will use the fact that $\delta_z$ is either real ($\delta_z \in \mathbb{R}$) or purely imaginary ($\delta_z \in i\mathbb{R}$) and thus that $\omega^2$ is always real and positive. This is proved in appendix \oldref{kzreal}.
%This can be shown by eliminating $\omega$ between (\ref{EqFullDispera}) and (\ref{EqFullDisperb}) and expressing $\delta_x^2$ as a function of $\delta_z$. It can then be shown analytically in simplified cases (such as $\epsilon_a$=0) or graphically in more complicated cases that for $\delta_x$ to be real $\delta_z$ has to be either real or pure imaginary.
It is important to note that $\omega$ is forced to be real by the boundary dispersion relation, and that other solutions are possible when considering the inner dispersion relation only. These solutions will not be discussed in the following, even in Section \oldref{SectionInner} on waves in an unbounded ocean.\\
The waves associate with real $\delta_z$ are {\it vertically propagating} while the ones associated with imaginary $\delta_z$ are {\it vertically evanescent}.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: the inner dispersion relation corresponding to waves in an unbounded ocean is studied in Section \oldref{SectionInner}. Additional constraints related to the boundary dispersion relation, i.e., in a bounded ocean, are added in Section \oldref{SectionGraphic}.
%Several difficulties can be anticipated. Firstly, one already noted in subsection \ref{SubSectionDisp} that the inner dispersion relations were fourth-order relations in $(\delta_x,\ \delta_z,\ \omega)$, a consequence being that the corresponding surfaces are quartics and shall only be associated locally to simpler, well-known quadric surfaces (i.e. under further assumptions that will have to be clearly stated). Intersections and roots can indeed be simply derived analytically in this latter case. A consequence is that several local approximations will have be proposed, each corresponding to one type of waves associated to one set of parameters. A second major difficulty to carry out some analytical investigation is that the boundary dispersion relation is a transcendental relation and the intersections with the inner dispersion surface, when they exist, can not be easily derived and further investigation  requires additional assumptions.\\

When not explicitly mentioned, the standard values of the parameters used in the rest of the paper are listed in Table \oldref{TableParameters}.

\section{Inner dispersion relation \& waves in an unbounded ocean}
\label{SectionInner}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The inner dispersion relation \ref{EqFullDispera} must be satisfied by any type of ocean waves whether or not the ocean is considered as a locally unbounded medium (far from surface and bottom). We will show in the present section that (i) in $(\delta_x,\  \delta_z,\ \omega)$ phase-space, the inner dispersion relation leads to a three-branch dispersion surface, (ii) two acoustic and stratification reference functions $\omega_a(\delta_x,\ \delta_z)$ and $\omega_i(\delta_x,\ \delta_z)$ are good approximations of the branches, (iii) the upper and lower branches of the inner dispersion surface (for respectively high and low frequencies) correspond to acoustic waves and internal rays propagating in an unbounded ocean and (iv) the bounded central branch of the inner dispersion surface corresponds to vertically vanishing waves, which are referred to as surface waves in the following.

As explained above, we consider here only regular, stable solutions, i.e., the case where frequency $\omega$ is real. The stability of the solutions will generally be imposed by boundary conditions, as proved in appendix \oldref{kzreal} for the specific case of a free surface ocean (our concern here) and for physically meaningful values of small parameters $\epsilon_i$, $\epsilon_a$.

%To further investigate the inner dispersion relation \ref{EqFullDispera}, the evolution of the vertical wave-number $\delta_z$ as a function of the horizontal wave-number $\delta_x$ and of the pulsation $\omega$ is now further investigated. Note that the case of long waves will be considered separately in the following sections so that $\delta_x$ and $\delta_z$ do not need to be simultaneously small to start with.

%\subsection{Branches of the inner dispersion relation: compressibility \& stratification.}
%\subsection{Branches of the inner dispersion relation}

\subsection{Acoustic and stratification reference frequencies}
\label{SubSectionFactoDisp}

%All terms in the above inner dispersion relation (whether $\delta_z$ is real or pure imaginary) are quadratic in $(\delta_x,\ \delta_z,\ \omega)$ expect the first term of the right-hand-side $(\epsilon_i^2 \delta_x^2/\omega^2)$ which is quadratic in $\delta_x$ and inversely proportional to the square of the pulsation. It is related to the ocean stratification and brings in internal gravity waves. A further investigation shows that this term is in fact associated to vertical advection through last term of the state equation \ref{WM_d}. After multiplication by $\omega^2$ to avoid a singularity for $\omega = 0$ (see Eq. \ref{eqomegaparam2} bellow), the inner dispersion relation for stratified ocean is fourth order in $(\delta_x,\ \delta_z,\ \omega)$, increasing somehow the analytical burden. The boundary dispersion relations \ref{EqFullDisperb} includes a transcendental function ($tan(delta_z)$ with $\delta_z\in\mathbb{C}$).

%\subsubsection{Acoustic and stratification factorizing functions $(\omega_a,\ \omega_i)$}
%\label{subsubsectionFacto}

To gain insight in the physics of wave solutions, the inner dispersion relation \ref{EqFullDispera} is rewritten below:
%
\begin{equation}
\delta_x^2+\delta_z^2 =\epsilon_i^2\frac{\delta_x^2}
{\omega^2}+\epsilon_a^2\omega^2-\frac{(\epsilon_a^2+\epsilon_i^2)^2}{4}
	\label{eqomegaparam2}
\end{equation}
%
Following \cite{RevModPhys.35.207}, it can be reformulated in the simpler form:
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\omega^2}{\omega_a^2}+\frac{\omega_i^2}{\omega^2}=1
	\label{eqlink}
\end{equation}
%
where $\omega_i$ and $\omega_a$ are functions of horizontal and vertical wavenumbers, defined by:
%
\begin{subequations}
	\label{EqDispSols}
	\begin{alignat}{2}	
	\label{SolAcous}
	& \omega_a^2(\delta_x,\ \delta_z) &&=\frac{1}{\epsilon_a^2}\left(
	\delta_x^2+\delta_z^2
	+\frac{(\epsilon_a^2+\epsilon_i^2)^2}{4}
	\right)\\
	\label{SolGrav}
	&\omega_i^2(\delta_x,\ \delta_z)  &&=
	\frac{\delta_x^2\ \epsilon_i^2}{\delta_x^2+\delta_z^2
	+(\epsilon_a^2+\epsilon_i^2)^2/4}
	\end{alignat}
\end{subequations}
%
These two functions are not roots of the inner dispersion equation \ref{eqomegaparam2} but they are useful in their approximation and, more specifically, in their physical interpretation:

	$\epsilon_a^2\omega^2 \gg \frac{\epsilon_i^2\delta_x^2}{\omega^2}$ (high frequency) then \ref{eqomegaparam2} simplifies to $\omega^2\approx\omega_a^2$, relevant to a compressible, homogeneous (unstratified) ocean.
	\item If $\epsilon_a^2\omega^2 \ll \frac{\epsilon_i^2\delta_x^2}{\omega^2}$ (low frequency) then \ref{eqomegaparam2} simplifies to $\omega^2\approx\omega_i^2$, relevant to an incompressible, stratified ocean.
\end{itemize}
%
Therefore, $\omega_a$ can be interpreted as a  \textit{reference acoustic function} accounting for the compressibility content of the inner dispersion relation, and is solution of the \textit{inner} dispersion relation for an homogeneous ocean. $\omega_i$ plays an equivalent role for ocean stratification: it can be interpreted as a  \textit{reference stratification function} and is solution of the \textit{inner} dispersion relation for an incompressible ocean.\\

%Both functions depend on $\epsilon_a^2+\epsilon_i^2 = H/D_0$, the stratification scale-depth ratio with no compressible correction. 
%When $\epsilon_a$ tends toward zero (compressibility vanishes), $\omega_a$ approaches infinity and the first term of \ref{eqlink} vanishes for a finite pulsation $\omega$. 
%When $\epsilon_i$ tends in turn toward zero (weak stratifications), $\omega_i$ approaches zero and the second term of \ref{eqlink} vanishes if the pulsation $\omega$ remains finite. 
%\\

Recall that we consider only regular solutions for which the frequency $\omega$ is real and $\delta z$ is either real or purely imaginary. In addition, $\omega_a^2$ and $\omega_i^2$ have the same sign, since their product is equal to $\delta_x^2\frac{\epsilon_i^2}{\epsilon_a^2} > 0$. Therefore \ref{eqlink} implies that $\omega_a^2\ge 0, \omega_i^2 \ge 0$, and that:
\[
\omega_i^2(\delta_x, \delta_z)\le \omega^2(\delta_x, \delta_z) \le \omega_a^2(\delta_x, \delta_z) \qquad\forall (\delta_x, \delta_z)
\]
Therefore, frequency is always bounded by $\omega_i$ and $\omega_a$.\\

%\subsubsection{Roots of the inner dispersion relation $(\omega_\pm)$}
Let us now define $R(\delta_x,\delta_z)$ the ratio of stratification to acoustic frequencies:
%
\begin{equation}
R^2(\delta_x,\delta_z)=
\frac{\omega_i^2}{\omega_a^2}=
\frac{\epsilon_a^2\epsilon_i^2\delta_x^2}
{\left(\delta_x^2+\delta_z^2
	+\frac{(\epsilon_a^2+\epsilon_i^2)^2}{4}
	\right)^2}
\label{eqratio}
\end{equation}
%
$R(\delta_x,\ \delta_z)$ is an important criterion for locating the roots of the inner dispersion relation.
The condition $\displaystyle R^2=\frac{\omega_i^2}{\omega_a^2}\le \frac{1}{4}$ is required for Equation \ref{eqlink} to present two real roots, and thus for $\omega^2$ to be real. These roots can be formulated for the squared frequency:
%
\begin{equation}
	\omega_{\pm}^2
	=\frac{\omega_a^2}{2}
	\left(
	1\pm
	\sqrt{1-4\underbrace{\frac{\omega_i^2}{\omega_a^2}}_{\equiv\ R^2}}
	\right)
\label{solseq}
\end{equation}
%
%{\color{red}dire que si $R$ est petit on a la separation des roots et elles sont egales a omegaa, omegai}\\
When $R^2$ is small, the two roots are well separated and correspond to $\omega_+\approx \omega_a, \omega_-\approx \omega_i$. It is also important to note that the product of the two roots $\omega_-^2 \omega_+^2$ is always equal to $\displaystyle \omega_a^2\omega_i^2=\frac{\epsilon_i^2}{\epsilon_a^2}\delta_x^2$ and thus we have:
%
\begin{equation}
\omega_i^2(\delta_x, \delta_z)\le \omega_-^2(\delta_x, \delta_z) \le \frac{\epsilon_i}{\epsilon_a}\delta_x \le \omega_+^2(\delta_x, \delta_z) \le \omega_a^2(\delta_x, \delta_z).
\label{boundedomega2}
\end{equation}
%
%The condition $\displaystyle R^2(\delta_x,\delta_z)\le \frac{1}{4}$ is required for the dispersion relation \ref{eqomegaparam2} to have a real root. If, on the contrary $\displaystyle R^2(\delta_x,\delta_z) >\frac{1}{4}$, the solution is not an oscillatory wave-solution: its pulsation is complex with both a damped and an amplified solution.
%\\
%For small $\epsilon_i$ and $\epsilon_a$ parameters, these two roots can be compared to the acoustic and stratification functions $\omega_a$ and $\omega_i$:
%\begin{subequations}
%	\begin{alignat}{2}
%	\label{Comp1}
%	&\omega_a^2(\delta_x,\ \delta_z)-\omega_{+}^2(\delta_x,\ \delta_z)
%	&&=\frac{\epsilon_i^2\delta_x^2}{\delta_x^2+\delta_z^2}
%	+\mathrm{O}	(\epsilon_i^p,\epsilon_a^{6-p})\\[3mm]
%	\label{Comp2}
%	&\omega_{-}^2(\delta_x,\ \delta_z)-\omega_i^2(\delta_x,\ \delta_z)
%	&&=\frac{\epsilon_i^4\epsilon_a^2\delta_x^4}{(\delta_x^2+\delta_z^2)^3}
%	+\mathrm{O}	(\epsilon_a^q,\epsilon_i^{10-q})
%	\end{alignat}	
%\end{subequations}
%with $(p,\ q)\in\{2,\ 4,\ 6\}^2$. These Taylor developments show that the first root $(\omega_+)$ approaches the \textit{acoustic function} $(\omega_a)$ when the stratification loosen ($\epsilon_i$ tends toward 0). Both $\omega_+$  and $\omega_a$ approach infinity when $\epsilon_a$ tends toward zero (i.e. when compressibility vanishes). The second root $(\omega_-)$ approaches the \textit{stratification function} $(\omega_i)$ when $\epsilon_a$ tends toward zero. $\omega_-$, $\omega_i$ and their difference approach 0 when $\epsilon_a$ tends toward zero (i.e. when stratification weakens). \\
%%The second term of \ref{eqlink} vanishes this time if the pulsation $\omega$ remains finite.\\
%However $\omega_a$ (receptively $\omega_i$) are good approximations of $\omega_+$ ($\omega_-$) only if $\delta_z\in\mathbb{R}$. Indeed, the sum of the square of the wave-numbers at the denominator of the right-hand-sides of the above relations can be arbitrarily small (even for large $\delta_x$) if $\delta_z\in i \ \mathbb{R}$. In this case, the roots $(\omega_\pm)$ might not be well-approximated by $\omega_a$ and $\omega_i$.\\
%To proceed, the dependency of the form and solutions of the inner dispersion relation to the vertical wave-number $\delta_z$ consequently needs to be investigated.

%\subsection{Dispersion relations in $(\delta_x,\ \delta_z,\ \omega)$ phase space}
%\label{SubSectionDispSurfIntro}

%In an unbounded ocean (far from the bottom and of the surface of the ocean), ocean waves only need to satisfy the inner-ocean dispersion relation \ref{EqFullDispera}. Pure internal and acoustic waves are examples of such waves. Many more types of waves can propagate in the ocean but if this assumption is relaxed, waves must satisfy simultaneously the inner and the bottom dispersion relations. These waves can basically be divided in two categories. The first category gathers evanescent waves which do not propagate vertically. Their vertical wave-number is a pure-imaginary complex $(\delta_z\in i\mathbb{R})$. Waves from the second category are usually called "wave modes": they do not propagate vertically either but their vertical wave-number must be "quantified" to satisfy the bottom and surface boundary conditions: it is solution of a discrete eigenvalue problem. As already stated in the introductory review, internal-gravity and acoustic-gravity modes are well-known examples of such modes.\\

%Ocean waves can consequently propagate in a $(x,\ z)$ vertical section of a "bounded ocean" if the triplet of wave-properties $(\delta_x,\ \delta_z,\ \omega)$ satisfy the 2 relations \ref{EqFullDispera} and \ref{EqFullDisperb}. This leaves only one degree of freedom to impose forcing (against two for waves propagating in an unbounded ocean). In the rather general context of a stratified and compressible ocean, two parameters $(\epsilon_i,\ \epsilon_a)$ have been identified to render the relative impact of gravity and compressibility in the propagation mechanism. The resulting set of two equations of three variables and two parameters is non-linear and simple general solution cannot be carried out analytically. Much insight can yet be gained in these ocean waves investigating geometrically the inner and boundary surfaces associated to the corresponding dispersion relations. \\
%Indeed, in $(\delta_x,\  \delta_z,\ \omega)$ phase-space, the inner and boundary dispersion relations are respectively given by two surfaces. When these two surfaces intersect, points lying on the intersection are triplets of wave solutions. The surfaces associated respectively to the inner and boundary relations shall now respectively be named the \textit{inner and boundary dispersion surfaces}.\\

%Several difficulties can be anticipated. Firstly, one already noted in subsection \ref{SubSectionDisp} that the inner dispersion relations were fourth-order relations in $(\delta_x,\ \delta_z,\ \omega)$, a consequence being that the corresponding surfaces are quartics and shall only be associated locally to simpler, well-known quadric surfaces (i.e. under further assumptions that will have to be clearly stated). Intersections and roots can indeed be simply derived analytically in this latter case. A consequence is that several local approximations will have be proposed, each corresponding to one type of waves associated to one set of parameters. A second major difficulty to carry out some analytical investigation is that the boundary dispersion relation is a transcendental relation and the intersections with the inner dispersion surface, when they exist, can not be easily derived and further investigation  requires additional assumptions.\\ 

\subsection{Three regions in $(\delta_x,\ \delta_z,\ \omega)$ phase-space}
\label{SubSectionDeltaz}
%
\begin{figure}[!h]
	\centering	
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{FIGURES/Contour_dz.png}
	\caption{\textit{contours of $\ \delta_z^2(\delta_x,\ \omega)$}. Plain lines represent positive values $(\delta_z\in\mathbb{R})$, and dashed lines negative values $(\delta_z\in i\mathbb{R})$.}
	\label{FigContourdz}
\end{figure}
%
Figure \oldref{FigContourdz} shows variations of the squared vertical wavenumber $\delta_z^2$ as a function of $(\delta_x,\ \,\omega)$ for the values of $\epsilon_i, \epsilon_a$ given in table \ref{TableParameters}.  Negative values are encountered for medium-range frequencies $(10^{-1.7}<\omega<10^{0.7})$ and large enough horizontal wavenumbers $(\delta_x \geq 0.1-0.2)$. This region is surrounded by high and low frequency regions of positive $\delta_z^2$. The transition lines between these regions are given by $\delta_z=0$:
%
\begin{itemize}
	\item If $\omega \gg 1$ and $\epsilon_a \ne 0$ then $\omega^2\approx\omega_a^2$ and the transition line is given by 
	$\epsilon_a^2\omega^2 \approx
	\delta_x^2
 	+\frac{(\epsilon_a^2+\epsilon_i^2)^2}{4}$. This line is a parabola and the frequency is not bounded when $\delta_x$ increases. 
% 	When $\delta_x$ goes to 0, $\omega$ decreases monotically and reaches its lower bound for $\delta_x=0$: its minimum is given by $\omega_{c,a}=(\epsilon_a^2+\epsilon_i^2)/2\epsilon_a$.
	\item If $\omega \ll 1$ and $\epsilon_i \ne 0$ then $\omega^2\approx\omega_i^2$, the equation of the transition line is $\omega^2\approx\delta_x^2\epsilon_i^2/(\delta_x^2+(\epsilon_a^2+\epsilon_i^2)^2/4)$. This line has an upper bound $\omega_{c,i}=\epsilon_i$.
	In dimensional form, this bound can be rewritten $\Omega\leq N$ and is related to the well-known cut-off frequency for internal gravity waves.% \cite{dukowicz_2013}.
\end{itemize}
%
Therefore, the inner dispersion relation \ref{EqFullDispera} authorizes three types of wave solutions: two with real vertical wavenumbers $(\delta_z^2\geq0)$ and one with purely imaginary wavenumbers $(\delta_z^2<0)$.

\subsubsection{Real vertical wavenumber $(\delta_z\in\mathbb{R})$}
\label{realwavenumber}
%Figure \ref{FigContourdz} presents the evolution of the square of the vertical wave-number as a function of $\delta_x$ and $\omega$. Two regions of positive $(\delta_z^2)$ are separated by one region of negative $(\delta_z^2)$. 

The ratio of reference functions $\displaystyle R^2(\delta_x,\delta_z)$, defined by \ref{eqratio}, depends on two variables $(\delta_x,\ \delta_z)$ and two parameters $(\epsilon_i,\ \epsilon_a)$. A study of its variations for $\delta_x \in \mathbb{R}$ shows that, for non-vanishing $(\epsilon_i,\ \epsilon_a)$, it has an upper bound:
%
\begin{equation}
	 \max_{\delta_x} R^2(\delta_x,\delta_z) =\frac{1}{4}
	\frac{\epsilon_a^2\epsilon_i^2}{\delta_z^2+\frac{\left
	(\epsilon_a^2+\epsilon_i^2
	\right)^2}{4}}.
\label{boundR2}
\end{equation}
%
This maximum value is attained for $\delta_x^2=\delta_z^2+\frac{(\epsilon_a^2+\epsilon_i^2)^2}{4}$.
We see that $R^2$ approaches $1/4$ (and thus the two roots $\omega_+$ and $\omega_-$ coincide) for both a near depth-independent vertical profile (i.e. $\delta_z \approx 0$\footnote{We use the term {\it depth-independent} even if $F(z)$ is a linear function of $z$ when $\delta_z$ is close to $0$ (see \ref{EqDispRef}), so that the vertical profile of $W(z)$ is approximately linear while the vertical profile of $U(z)$ is approximately constant.}) and $\epsilon_a \approx \epsilon_i$ (or in dimensional form $N=g/c_s$). This last equality is true when the stratification and the compressibility effects have an identical contribution to the vertical variation of background stratification $\hat{\rho}_h(z)$. In all other cases, the vast majority, the two roots are well separated and given by:
%Since we are here in the case of an unbounded ocean\footnote{If this constraint would have been omitted, a value of $R^2=\frac{1}{4}$ could be attained for $\delta_z=0$, $\epsilon_i=\epsilon_a$. In this case, $\delta_x^2=\frac{(\epsilon_a^2+\epsilon_i^2)^2}{4}=\epsilon_a^4$ and this leads to a dual root of $\omega_\pm^2=\frac{\omega_a^2}{2}=\frac{\delta_x^2}{\epsilon_a^2}=\epsilon_a^2$ (or $\Omega^2=c_s^2k_x^2$).}, we do not consider the case of small $\delta_z$ and  \ref{boundR2} shows that  $R$ is small and thus the two solutions are well separated with 
\begin{equation}
\omega_{-}(\delta_x,\ \delta_z) \approx \omega_i
(\delta_x,\ \delta_z), \quad
\omega_{+}(\delta_x,\ \delta_z) \approx \omega_a(\delta_x,\ \delta_z)
\end{equation}
These two roots are studied below.

\paragraph{Modified internal waves (MIW)}
The traditional dispersion relation for dispersive internal gravity wave rays in the context of a Boussinesq incompressible fluid (\citealt{gill_1982}; see also Table \oldref{TableWave solutions} above) is:
%
\begin{equation}
\omega_{iwr}^2=\epsilon_i^2\frac{ \delta_x^2}{\delta_x^2+\delta_z^2}
\label{DispRays}
\end{equation}
%
A Taylor expansion of the gravity-wave root $\omega_{-}^2$ given by \ref{solseq} with respect to the small parameters $\epsilon_a$ and $\epsilon_i$ leads to:
\begin{align}
\frac{\omega_-^2}{\omega_{iwr}^2}&=1
-
	\left(
	\frac{(\epsilon_i^2+\epsilon_a^2)^2}{4(\delta_x^2+\delta_z^2)}
	-\frac{\epsilon_i^2\epsilon_a^2 \delta_x^2}{(\delta_x^2+\delta_z^2)^2}
	\right)
+\mathrm{O}((\epsilon_i^{2}+\epsilon_a^{2})^4) \label{DispRaysDT}
\\
&=1
-\underbrace{\frac{(\epsilon_i^2+\epsilon_a^2)^2\delta_z^2+(\epsilon_a^2-\epsilon_i^2)^2\delta_x^2}{4(\delta_x^2+\delta_z^2)^2}}_{\mathrm{O}((\epsilon_i^{2}+\epsilon_a^{2})^2)}
+\mathrm{O}((\epsilon_i^{2}+\epsilon_a^{2})^4),  \label{DispRaysDTfact}
\end{align}
%
while the development of $\omega_i^2$ leads to
\[
\frac{\omega_i^2}{\omega_{iwr}^2}=1
-\underbrace{\frac{(\epsilon_i^2+\epsilon_a^2)^2}{4(\delta_x^2+\delta_z^2)}}_{\mathrm{O}((\epsilon_i^{2}+\epsilon_a^{2})^2)}
+\mathrm{O}((\epsilon_i^{2}+\epsilon_a^{2})^4).
\]
Compared with $\omega_i^2$, $\omega_-^2$ includes corrective terms due to the two roots of the inner dispersion relation not being fully separated. The corrective term $\displaystyle \frac{\epsilon_i^2\epsilon_a^2 \delta_x^2}{4(\delta_x^2+\delta_z^2)^2}$ is naturally close to $R^2$. It is trivial to see from formulation \ref{DispRaysDTfact} that the combined effect of compressibility and stratification is always a reduction of frequency, compared with the approximated value $\omega_{iwr}$: $\omega_-^2\le \omega_{iwr}^2$.\\
%is recovered at fourth order in $\epsilon_i$ and $\epsilon_a$.
%Relations \ref{DispRaysDT} and \ref{DispRays} further show that $\omega_{iwr}^2/\epsilon_i^2$ is a fourth-order approximation of $\omega_i^2/\epsilon_i^2$ and is itself an approximation of the general root $\omega_-^2/\epsilon_i^2$.
%As a consequence, when parameters $\epsilon_i^2$ and $\epsilon_a^2$  are both small, the stratification function $\omega_i(\delta_x,\delta_z)$ is an internal gravity wave ray modified by compressibility and propagating in an unbounded ocean.
%%Both corrective terms on the right-hand-side are proportional to $\epsilon_i^2+\epsilon_a^2=H/D_0$ and consequently depends on the relative strength of the stratification (with no compressibility correction).
%The first corrective term can only reduce the pulsation, the last term can only increase it. However it can be shown that the combined effect is always a reduction of the pulsation, i.e. $\omega_{-}^2 \le \omega_{iwr}^2$. We postpone the discussion on the compressibilty effects on the pulsation in the section on bounded ocean. Indeed, as can be seen on Eq. \ref{DispRaysDT} this effect is strongly dependent on the vertical wavenumber $\delta_z$ whose possible values are limited in the bounded ocean cases.\\

Ocean waves satisfying \ref{DispRaysDT} will now be referred to as \textit{Modified Internal Waves (MIW)}.

\paragraph{Modified acoustic waves (MAW)}
The well-known dispersion relation for acoustic waves in an homogeneous fluid is:
%
\begin{equation}
\omega_{aw}^2 =\frac{1}{\epsilon_a^2}\left(\delta_x^2+\delta_z^2\right)
\label{DispAcous}
\end{equation}
%
A Taylor development of the acoustic root $(\omega_+)$ with respect to $\epsilon_a$ and $\epsilon_i$ leads this time to:
%
\begin{align}
\frac{\omega_+^2}{\omega_{aw}^2}&=1
+
\left(
\frac{(\epsilon_i^2+\epsilon_a^2)^2}{4(\delta_x^2+\delta_z^2)}
-\frac{\epsilon_i^2\epsilon_a^2 \delta_x^2}{(\delta_x^2+\delta_z^2)^2}
\right)
+\mathrm{O}((\epsilon_i^{2}+\epsilon_a^{2})^4)
\label{DispAcousDT}\\
&=1+\underbrace{\frac{(\epsilon_i^2+\epsilon_a^2)^2\delta_z^2+(\epsilon_a^2-\epsilon_i^2)^2\delta_x^2}{4(\delta_x^2+\delta_z^2)^2}}_{\mathrm{O}((\epsilon_i^{2}+\epsilon_a^{2})^2)}
+\mathrm{O}((\epsilon_i^{2}+\epsilon_a^{2})^4), \label{DispAcousDTfact}
\end{align}
%
while the development of $\omega_a^2$ leads to
\[
\frac{\omega_a^2}{\omega_{aw}^2}=1+
\underbrace{\frac{(\epsilon_i^2+\epsilon_a^2)^2}{4(\delta_x^2+\delta_z^2)}}_{\mathrm{O}((\epsilon_i^{2}+\epsilon_a^{2})^2)}
+\mathrm{O}((\epsilon_i^{2}+\epsilon_a^{2})^4).
\]
Compared with $\omega_a^2$, $\omega_+^2$ includes corrective terms due to the two roots of the inner dispersion relation not being fully separated. Again, the corrective term is small and close to $R^2$. The combined effect of compressibility and stratification is always an increase of frequency, compared with the approximated value $\omega_{aw}$: $\omega_+^2\ge \omega_{aw}^2$.\\

Ocean waves satisfying \ref{DispAcousDT} will be called \textit{Modified Acoustic Waves (MAW)} in the following. The modifications to usual internal and acoustic wave dispersion relations by compressibility and stratification effects are expressed by:
\[
\omega_+^2\omega_-^2=\frac{\epsilon_i^2}{\epsilon_a^2}\delta_x^2=\omega_{aw}^2\omega_{iwr}^2,
\]
which explains the symmetry in the above developments for modified internal and acoustic waves.

\subsubsection{Purely imaginary vertical wavenumber $(\delta_z\in i\ 
\mathbb{R})$}
\label{subsubsectioniR}

If now $\delta_z$ is a purely imaginary complex, it can be written $\delta_z=i\delta_{z,i}$ with $\delta_{z,i}\in\mathbb{R}$ and wave solutions are vertically evanescent. The boundary dispersion relation now writes:
\begin{equation}
\label{EqFullDisperbi}
\omega^2=\frac{\delta_x^2\tanh(\delta_{z,i})}
{\delta_{z,i}+\frac{\epsilon_a^2+\epsilon_i^2}{2}\tanh(\delta_{z,i})}
\end{equation}
and the inner dispersion relation:
%
\begin{equation}
	\label{EqFullDisperai}
 		\delta_x^2-\delta_{z,i}^2 =\epsilon_i^2\frac{\delta_x^2}
 			{\omega^2}+\epsilon_a^2\omega^2-\frac{(\epsilon_a^2+\epsilon_i^2)^2}{4}
		%\label{EqFullDisperbi}
		%& \omega^2 &&=\frac{\delta_x^2\ tanh(\delta_{z,i})}
		%{\delta_{z,i}+\frac{\epsilon_a^2+\epsilon_i^2}			{2}tanh(\delta_{z,i})}
		%=\frac{\delta_x^2}{\frac{\epsilon_a^2+\epsilon_i^2}{2}
		%+\delta_z cotan(\delta_z)}
\end{equation}
%
When horizontal and vertical wavenumbers are close together, the left-hand side and  right-hand side of  \ref{EqFullDisperai} both vanish, i.e., the influence of stratification $(\epsilon_i^2\delta_x^2/\omega^2)$ and compressibility $(\epsilon_a^2\omega_a^2)$ cancel out. In other words, differences between horizontal and vertical wavenumbers are indication of the influence of ocean stratification and/or compressibility. In an incompressible, homogeneous (unstratified) ocean, $\epsilon_i=\epsilon_a=0$ and vertical and horizontal wave-numbers are equal.

The developments of $\omega_-^2, \omega_+^2$ for small $\epsilon_i, \epsilon_a$ are identical to those for real vertical wavenumbers \ref{DispRaysDT}, \ref{DispAcousDT} just replacing $\delta_z^2$ by $-\delta_{z,i}^2$.

The remaining question is that of root separation when $\delta_z\in i\ \mathbb{R}$. Unlike when $\delta_z\in \mathbb{R}$ (previous sub-section), the ratio $R^2(\delta_x,\ i\ \delta_{z,i})$ can be equal to $1/4$ even when $\delta_z$ is not small.
Relation \ref{EqFullDisperai} imposes $0\le \delta_{z,i}^2\le \delta_x^2+\frac{(\epsilon_a^2+\epsilon_i^2)^2}{4}$ and in this range of values, $R^2$ is an increasing function of $\delta_{z,i}^2$. The value of $R^2=1/4$ is attained for $\delta_{z,i}^2=\delta_{z,i,\star}^2$ given by:
%
\begin{equation}
	\delta_{z,i,\star}^2=\delta_x^2+\frac{(\epsilon_a^2+\epsilon_i^2)^2}{4}-2\epsilon_a\epsilon_i\delta_x,
	\label{deltazi}
\end{equation} 
%
for which the inner dispersion relation has a double root $\displaystyle \omega_+^2 = \omega_-^2 = \frac{\epsilon_i}{\epsilon_a}\delta_x$.
When $\delta_{z,i}$ is less than $\delta_{z,i,\star}$, the two roots become separated.
Again, since we look only at regular solutions, the case $\delta_{z,i}^2>\delta_{z,i,\star}^2$, which would lead to $R^2 > 1/4$ is not considered.

Even if \ref{EqFullDisperai} has two roots, the two corresponding branches are always connected, as shown above, and thus form one family of ocean waves.
Ocean waves satisfying \ref{EqFullDisperai} will be called {\it Modified Surface Waves (MSW)} in the following.
%Far from this region, i.e. if can find a strictly-positive constant $\alpha$ such that:
%%i.e. if we can find $\alpha>0$ such that $R^2\leq 1/4(1-\alpha^2)$ or in $(\delta_x,\ \delta_z,\ \omega)$ phase-space (sufficient relation):
%\begin{equation}
%	\label{regsepi}
%	\delta_x^2-\delta_{z,i}^2\geq
%	\frac{2\epsilon_i\epsilon_a\delta_x}
%	{\sqrt{1-\alpha^2}}
%\end{equation}
%then, from Relation \ref{eqratio}, $R^2\leq (1-\alpha^2)/4$ and, from Relation \ref{deltaomegapm}, the roots are well-separated:
%\begin{subequations}
%	\begin{alignat}{2}	
%	&\omega_{+}^2-\omega_{-}^2 &&=\omega_a^2\sqrt{1-4 R^2}\\[3mm]
%	& &&\geq \alpha\omega_a^2 
%	\geq \alpha\frac{(\epsilon_i^2+\epsilon_a^2)^2}{4\epsilon_a^2}
%	\end{alignat}
%\end{subequations}
%Then the relations \ref{Comp1} and \ref{Comp2} with \ref{regsepi} lead to two additional inequalities:
%\begin{subequations}
%	\begin{alignat}{2}
%	\label{Comp1b}
%	&\omega_a^2(\delta_x,\ i\delta_{z,i})-\omega_{+}^2(\delta_x,\ i\delta_{z,i})
%	&&\leq\frac{\epsilon_i\sqrt{1-\alpha^2}}{2\epsilon_a}\ \delta_x\\[3mm]
%	\label{Comp2b}
%	&\omega_{-}^2(\delta_x,\ i\delta_{z,i})-\omega_i^2(\delta_x,\ i\delta_{z,i})
%	&& \leq\frac{\epsilon_i (1-\alpha^2)^{3/2}}{2\epsilon_a}\frac{1}{\delta_x}
%	\end{alignat}	
%\end{subequations}
%These relations show that for $\delta_z\in i\ \mathbb{R}$, the roots are well-separated in the region of phase-space far enough from the plane $\delta_x=\delta_{z,i}$ \ref{regsepi}.
% and, in such a region of the phase space, the root $\omega_+$ (respectively $\omega_-$) can be as close as required from the acoustic (stratification) function if $\delta_x$ is decreased (respectively increased).


%\ref{EqFullDisper} has indeed a double ro
%If $\delta_z\in i\ \mathbb{R}$, \ref{EqFullDisperai} does not necessarily have two real %roots. Indeed it can vanish for $R^2=1/4$ or

\subsection{Summary: waves solutions in an unbounded ocean}
\label{SubSectionUsualDisp}

In the preceding analysis, three types of waves were identified. A synthesis is given by Figure \oldref{FigFullstratifiedcompressible} showing the inner dispersion surfaces for a stratified compressible ocean, and Figure \oldref{FigFullsimplifiedcases} showing limit cases for a homogeneous incompressible ocean. The values of the parameters $\epsilon_a, \epsilon_i$ are those of Table \oldref{TableParameters}.

Approximate frequency values for modified internal and acoustic waves are summarized in Table \oldref{Summary_unbounded_IA} and Table \oldref{TableWavesolutions_modified} in dimensional form, for comparison with introductory Table \oldref{TableWave solutions}. Since the practical existence and characterization of modified surface waves is strongly dependent on boundary conditions, they are not summarized here but will be detailed in the next section.

In a more realistic bounded ocean, their existence is guaranteed only if their vertical scale is (much) smaller than the ocean depth $(|\delta_z| \gg 1)$ and if they do not interfere with the bottom or the surface of the ocean. The next section will investigate the impact of adding the boundary dispersion relation \ref{EqFullDisperb}.
